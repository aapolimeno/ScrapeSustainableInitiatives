18405,99bng4,e4middo,t3_99bng4,europe,A study has found how climate change denial strongly linked to right-wing nationalism. Many of the right-wing nationalist parties in Europe now have climate change denial as one of their most important issues.,">In their article ‘Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States’ the authors state: ‘Clearly the extent to which the conservative white male effect on climate change denial exists outside the US is a topic deserving investigation.’ Following this recommendation, we report results from a study in Norway. McCright and Dunlap argue that climate change denial can be understood as an expression of protecting group identity and justifying a societal system that provides desired benefits. Our findings resemble those in the US study. A total of 63 per cent of conservative males in Norway do not believe in anthropogenic climate change, as opposed to 36 per cent among the rest of the population who deny climate change and global warming. Expanding on the US study, we investigate whether conservative males more often hold what we term xenosceptic views, and if that adds to the ‘cool dude-effect’.1 Multivariate logistic regression models reveal strong effects from a variable measuring **‘xenosceptic cool dudes’. Interpreting xenoscepticism as a rough proxy for right leaning views, climate change denial in Norway seems to merge with broader patterns of right-wing nationalism.**>

I have no doubt that conservatives are more likely to be dismissive of climate change, but fuck me, does the inclusion of ""xenosceptic views"" and the ""conservative white male effect"" give this study a whiff of impartiality.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,"not an initiative, should this be removed?

The U.S. and Germany have reached an agreement allowing completion of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, officials from both countries say

The U.S. and Germany have reached an agreement allowing the completion of a controversial Russian natural-gas pipeline, according to officials from Berlin and Washington, who expect to announce the deal as soon as Wednesday, bringing an end to years of tension between the two allies.

The Biden administration will effectively waive Washington’s longstanding opposition to the pipeline, Nord Stream 2, a change in the U.S. stance, ending years of speculation over the fate of the project, which has come to dominate European energy-sector forecasts. Germany under the agreement will agree to assist Ukraine in energy-related projects and diplomacy.

U.S. officials under the previous two presidential administrations opposed Nord Stream 2, out of fears it would heighten Moscow’s economic and political sway across Europe. The pipeline would allow the Kremlin to increase European dependence on its natural gas, then use it to blackmail U.S. allies, critics have said, charges Russia has dismissed.

President Biden, seeking closer ties with Europe and with Berlin in particular, waived U.S. sanctions against the Swiss-registered Russian pipeline firm, Nord Stream 2 AG, and its chief executive in May, signaling a change in the U.S. stance.

Mr. Biden continues to oppose the pipeline and views it as a Kremlin move to expand its influence over others, officials said Tuesday, but considers a united group of allies to be the most effective way to counter Moscow.

For Russia, the U.S.-Germany deal means it will be able to double the volume of natural gas exported directly to Germany via the pipeline beneath the Baltic Sea, while bypassing an existing route through Ukraine.

One person familiar with the talks said the deal was close to conclusion and expected in coming days. Another person familiar with the talks said the deal could be announced as early as Wednesday.

Under the four-point agreement, Germany and the U.S. would invest $50 million in Ukrainian green-tech infrastructure, encompassing renewable energy and related industries. Germany also would support energy talks in the Three Seas Initiative, a Central European diplomatic forum.

Berlin and Washington as well would try to ensure that Ukraine continues to receive roughly $3 billion in annual transit fees that Russia pays under its current agreement with Kyiv, which runs through 2024. Officials didn’t explain how to ensure that Russia continues to make the payments.

The U.S. also would retain the prerogative of levying future pipeline sanctions in the case of actions deemed to represent Russian energy coercion, officials in Washington said.

State Department spokesman Ned Price on Tuesday noted that Mr. Biden told German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a White House visit last week that “we continue to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,” while adding that the project was 90% complete when Mr. Biden took office and that officials didn’t think it could be stopped through sanctions.

German officials said they rejected a U.S. demand to include a so-called kill-switch clause in the pipeline’s operating rules. This would have enabled Berlin to suspend gas flows if Russia were to make aggressive moves toward its neighbors or Western allies. German negotiators argued that such state interference in a privately owned project could be the target of a legal challenge.

Berlin agreed instead not to reject future sanctions against the Russian energy sector, officials said.

The agreement between the Biden administration and Germany was described by officials in Berlin and Washington and by a congressional official familiar with the issue. Details of the agreement began circulating Monday evening, following a Reuters report on a possible deal.

Kyiv sees the existing gas-transit network in Ukraine and the revenue it brings as a check against Russia, especially after Moscow seized the Ukrainian region of Crimea and fomented rebellion in the country’s east in 2014. U.S. supporters of Ukraine have opposed any agreement permitting the construction of the pipeline.

“Any deal that allows for the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is badly flawed,” said Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Toomey urged the administration to impose sanctions “to halt Moscow’s efforts to weaponize the supply of gas in Europe.”

A focus of the forthcoming deal is the promotion of Ukrainian energy independence, said one of the people familiar with the talks, adding that the agreement ensures that Russia “cannot use energy as a coercive tool against Ukraine or any nation.”

Despite the U.S. sanctions waiver in May, this person said the U.S. would continue to examine entities involved in the project and will make clear “companies risk sanctions if they are involved in Nord Stream 2.”

Derek Chollet, a senior State Department policy adviser, is in Kyiv this week along with a German counterpart to inform Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of the agreement’s details. Mr. Chollet is scheduled for a similar trip to Poland, which has vehemently opposed the pipeline.

Word of the deal has rankled Ukrainian officials, who view the existing pipeline network in their country as a rare point of leverage against Russia in the two countries’ seven-year-old conflict. Last week, Mr. Putin delivered another in a series of polemics challenging Ukrainian sovereignty. Rendering the existing pipeline superfluous could offer Russia a freer military hand on Ukrainian territory, Ukraine advocates fear.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Mr. Biden told Ms. Merkel last week “that we have ongoing concerns about how the project threatens European energy security, undermines Ukraine’s security and the security of our…allies and partners.”

Ms. Psaki said Mr. Biden directed staffers to work jointly with German counterparts to complete an agreement.

An announcement of the deal was delayed to avoid eclipsing Ms. Merkel’s farewell visit to the White House, according to officials close to the negotiations. Ms. Merkel has made the completion of the pipeline, which could occur later this year, a signal achievement marking the close of her political career, people familiar with her thinking said.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,the comment is a summary of the article ,,,,,,,,

In my opinion, the fact that we live in developed countries alone is enough that we are exhausting more carbon dioxide per person than every developing country. 

If we really want to do something against climate change, we need to change a lot and also renounce a lot of convenient things. If the government forced us to renounce e.g. cars this would cost a lot of our freedom, so there needs to be another solution but I have no idea what.

1) The creation of the Aswan dam, in Egypt's Nile river, in 1964. The dam reduced the water running through the Nile towards the sea. It was carrying natural minerals and nutrients to the sea, consumed by plankton. This reduced plankton, and in turn fishes that eat plankton, and then the fish that eat smaller fishes that eat the plankton. It disrupted the whole marine food chain.

2) The invasion of Lagocephalus. Through the Suez canal, a fish native to the Indian Ocean came to the Mediterranean, that has no predator, and itself consumes a lot. The populations of species it eats, have been reduced significantly since it came.

Ah, not really. Mrs. Gustafssons company is tied to the fate of the vastly over budget OL3 EPR reactor in Olkiluoto through her companies share in *Fortum Power and Heat Oy*, which holds 25% share in the B series (OL3) reactor. Worse even, *Fortum* holds 100% of the planned fourth reactor from which there have been no news ever since the utility *TVO* announced to [not pursue construction](https://www.tvo.fi/modules/system/stdreq.aspx?P=2730&VID=default&SID=776124957778394&A=open%3aNews%3aItem%3a1615&S=2&C=31511). 

Is it vested self-interest or caring about the climate that's driving Mrs. Gustafsson here?

Also, to nitpick a bit, does it really help to ban paper and instead do everything electronically? 

Paper is essentially a renewable resource that can be produced 100% eco friendly. People assume that somehow you preserve forests by not using paper, which is actually the opposite. More demand for paper means that more trees have to be cut down for it, which in turn means that more trees have to be planted. In Europe the forests are growing in general. We don't cut down trees without replanting them anymore in this day and age.

But sides need to accept that each side has valid arguments and don't neither of them are completely right or wrong

Nuclear is a cleaner solution then coal or gas but gives us some big challenges
The current nuclear reactors are old and not exactly the safest thing that exists. New technologys exist but cost money and we all know capitalists hate to pay money.
Now there also comes the problem of long term storage
Germany had really bad experiences with long term storage due to unsafe mines and people not wanting to have nuclear waste stored under them.

Currently nuclear is the better option but over the long game neither nuclear or coal/gas is good

The Amazon is on fire pretty much all the time. The amazon is a big place, and pretty much every time lightning strikes the amazon a fire is started somewhere. yes, the Amazaon has been on fire fore weeks, but that isn't actually noteworthy, as weeks-long fires in the amazon is commonplace.
The actual new is that over the past year, fire occurrences in the amazon Brazil have gone up by 84%. Not just something that has been happening over the past few weeks, but something that has been going on over the past year.
Also, the loss of oxygen isn't a concern for humans. Yes, it generates 20% of global oxygen, but pretty much all of that is instantly used by the organisms in the forest, not by humans. Our oxygen comes mostly from plancton in the oceans.
The main concern is the loss of life. This month, we've lost 1.3km2 of forest. That's 1/5000th. If this continues, the organisms in the jungle have a serious problem.

According to BBC data, Brazilian Amazon fires generated around 1600 megatons of CO2 in the past ten years. According to Wikipedia 28 EU countries generated 3500 megatons. Per year.

That means we generate as much CO2 in half a year as Brazilian Amazon fires in the past ten years!

Also, according to BBC data the current fires are not out of the ordinary. Forests burn, and that's part of the cycle of life.

Nevertheless, it is important that Brazil tackles illegal logging and soybean cultivation. But us Europeans should start looking more at our own behavior than always trying to find the fault somewhere else - often former colonies.

When you burn wood fuel, you release most of the carbon dioxide stored in it back into the atmosphere, but you also incentivize a farm to grow more trees to sell. Not all of the tree can be turned into fuel, and that which is not fuel-worthy sequesters carbon into the ground. When you grow two trees for every one you burn and when you burn it, it only puts 80% of its carbon back into the atmosphere, you end up with net negative atmospheric carbon.

Is it the most efficient? No, but it's cheap and increases its effectiveness exponentially over time. It's a tool in the toolbox and shouldn't be discarded.

The EU has adopted new CO2 targets to curb climate change and committed to making them legally binding on member states. Thus, the EU wants to reduce carbon emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

With our modern electricity needs there aren't much solutions, either breaking uranium/thorium or burning coal/fuel. The first one is very effective but generates relatively small amounts of long terms non recyclable radioactive wastes, the second release massive amount of greenhouse gazes ( which is what Germany chose ).
Other solutions such as hydraulic can't be built everywhere and have a huge environmental impact. Solar and wind generate very small amount, are very polluting to produce and non-recyclable either.

Hydrogen could probably be a better choice but would require warmer relations with Russia for a reliable supply ...",,,,,,,,,,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"two opposing claims, this makes it impossible to annotate",,,,,,,,
