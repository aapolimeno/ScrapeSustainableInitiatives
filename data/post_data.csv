However, ""Shortly after the allegations emerged, an unnamed US official was quoted by Reuters as saying that intelligence suggested the men's symptoms were due to ""environmental"" factors, not poisoning. And later an official in the Ukrainian president's office, Ihor Zhovkva, told the BBC that while he hadn't spoken to Mr Abramovich, members of the Ukrainian delegation were 'fine' and one had said the story was 'false'.""

He was imprisoned and mistreated, and died in custody in November 2009, after being refused medical treatment. In this first tranche, the Government will honour Mr Magnitsky and all who defend the rule of law, with targeted sanctions and travel bans against 14 Russian individuals responsible for the serious corruption that he exposed and a further 25 Russian perpetrators and accomplices of his abuse and death. These individuals will be subject to targeted financial sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans.

129,knuti1,europe,"Chess, technocratic Octopus (crimes against humanity in EU/USA/others)",1,1.0,1609437848,,0,"Dear European Union and the Humanity as whole, this text also directed to members of the organization i call Octopus.

&amp;#x200B;

The core of this organization consists of members who are very intelligent, primarily researchers and doctors but also others, and they invented a plan in the form of a corona / covid and began to expand with such good intentions under the pretext of saving the Earth from ecological disaster. This action has certainly pleased a few people who are watching climate changes and have noticed that there has been a significant reduction in smog, but since it has been going on for more than a year and they also uses creation of artificial fear, it is time to show the truth and point humanity in the right direction.

It's been a year since the Corona story was made, and instead of acknowledging the need to significantly reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions and introduce normal rules, the organization is still working undercover, and I believe it's because of the crimes against the humanity that core of that organisations made.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that either the octopus has spread, or some kind of planetary movement of people has emerged that has different moral rules and values and they see that things have started to move, but in the wrong direction. I noticed a significant increase in interest in my person, whether through secret services (in the form of spyware and MITM attacks, my specialisation is IT and also IT security) but also through articles in the media indirectly referring to my person. It took me a while to decipher it all by deducing thinking and researching.

&amp;#x200B;

When my wife was sent with wrong healing fracture of feet to examination called by name gammametry of the skeleton, i was very interested about it and i started to study this examination technique the day before examination.

Atomic weapons, isotopes, radioactivity and the like are things that fascinate me and i like to study about them. You can call me a researcher in multiple scientific fields.

I feared about the increased amount of gamma radiation because i know how harmful it is. After studying available materials, i find out that a person gains a dose of gamma radiation of more than about a year of normal life, so we canceled it.

And we did well, because the available materials have been deceptive.

&amp;#x200B;

In my head this type of examination remained to resonate and i returned to study it and found, that it is much more dangerous than it looks and when the so-called radiopharmaceuticals are injected in the bloodstream they use isotopes which in addition to gamma radiation, emit beta radiation in the form of electrons during decay and cause a very unpleasant way of dying.

Person who undergoes the examination does not die immediately but his health gradually deteriorates and can die with a heart attack or get cancer or other health complications.

&amp;#x200B;

The examination itself takes a long time, about a half day until a pacient pee much of the the radiopharmaceutical and although he is no longer irradiating surroundings, the organs and cells, especially DNA are damaged to extend he cannot be saved.

This medical specialization under names nuclear medicine, scintigraphy or gammagraphy is used for crime and must be immediately stopped, authorities need to immediately take action, seize the evidence and create commissions to investigate. It is also needed to stop facilities called cyclotrons or synchrotrons, i will get to them later.

&amp;#x200B;

As a major indirect evidence i present:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Asolutely no existence of research on the non-harmless use of radiopharmaceuticals on animals or people in the long term, i have failed to find anything on the matter subject.

I would like to remind you of the incident that took place in Chernobyl when radioactive material (isotopes), get into air. Although it was other elementary particles, it doesnt matter at all.

When estimates of how many people died of cancer after the Chernobyl incident, it was estimated at 200,000 to 300,000.

Those people inhaled radioactive particles that were in the air and entered their bloodstream through their lungs, similar to smokers' nicotine or other harmful substances from cars. Now imagine that you get it directly through an injection into the bloodstream.

&amp;#x200B;

\- False information about physics of isotopes of elementary particles on Wikipedia and other sites, i suspect that they change the facts about isotopes of elementary particles and for example so-called Technitium-99m used with half life of 6 hours used in some examinations does not exist. Because there is not a lot of experts on the subject, other people accepts it as the truth.

Also the so-called Internal conversion, which is a method of converting atomic nuclei without emitting beta radiation when they decay into lower elements.

The organization changed the history of science and abuses the complexity of the topic as covering. I suppose that their claws are so long that you can also find false information the high school scripts as well.

&amp;#x200B;

If I am wrong at this one point and if the meta state of the isotopes also exists, some of these substances will still bind to the tissues and still remain in the body, causing heavy metal damage.

  It is necessary to use correct dosimeters to check what type of radiation is emitted by radiopharmaceuticals, gamma and beta and to distinguish the percentage, this can also confirm the type of isotopes contained in the radiopharmaceutical and there is need to use other techniques to identify the atoms themselves such as spectroscopy and the like.

&amp;#x200B;

\- On the [https://reddit.com/r/nuclearmedicine](https://reddit.com/r/nuclearmedicine) forum there is indirect evidence in the form of a complaint from one of the employees in America that complains about the congestion at work and the increase of people who come to test, the post on forum is month old. So yes, a few criminals alredy stared murdering more people.

&amp;#x200B;

\- On the same forum it is debated why nuclear medicine and classical RTG and CT are separated as medicinal fields, RTG and CT use as x-ray/gamma external source and that is very very big difference.

Also person asking for advice get recommendations to employ in a classic radio instead nuclear med. People who work in nuclear medicine prefer to send that person else for moral reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Because nuclear medicine is operated almost everywhere in the world but primarily in western democracy countries, I dare suppose this organisation is at planetary scale and created story of Corona and also I dare suppose there are other iniquities that needs to be stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

I infer that the momentary management of this organization is technocracy, the only one could commit abuse of scientific research on such terrible things. And it also uses the technique of artificial creation of fear, it is obvious because it has such practices and equipment.

&amp;#x200B;

Solution proposals:

For a moment i will play a role of the President of the Earth and I am giving you these recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

Police investigators - INVESTIGATION:

It is important to get the list of all patients examined with injected or drinked radiopharmaceuticals.

It is need to be verified how long they lived after the examination or if they are still alive how much their health detoriorate.

This also relates to other examinations where radiopharmaceuticals are injected into a blood circulation or drink, e.g. PET Scan, which can be done in other hospitals. PET itself is an abbreviation for POSITRON Emission Tomography, which is also cover name of use of hazardous beta radiation using isotopes injected directly into the bloodstream.

&amp;#x200B;

Involved will probably be some specialized doctors. It is necessary to identify them and interogatte them about this practice, if they know about it and identify if they used it and if yes, if they get the order from other octopus members or if they sent patients there on their behalf. Its important to distinguish if they used it because of fear of their families, or for money/fun or other reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ordinary people:

I propose to all citizens to make peaceful civil disobedience and ignore the vaccination against Corona until the vaccines will be independently verified and molecular structures of they contents published.

Be aware that these bad people can have plan to use some harmful substances in different batches of same vaccine. Authorities need to be aware of this.

Also please dont go outside to make mess down the streets, it's the last thing we need.

We need police officers, special units and army support to go after the bad guys.

I urge that use of other existing vaccines, especially the vaccination of children need to be accepted and trusted. Antivaxx movement is wrong.

Corona is really an exception.

I also propose to ignore multinational pharmaceutical companies that use Corona to increase profits because for the vaccines they create, countries must pay, these are our money used from taxes. We'll take them down, believe.

&amp;#x200B;

Within the EU states:

Police and special deployment units in the case of a nuclear dissaster (just pick up quality dosimeters): immediately send units into any cyclotron or synchrotron facilities. It is important to deploy enough people and you need to check all companies, clinics and warehouses around.

Isotopes for ""convicted"" patients are produced in these facilities.

It is necessary to use independent checking specialists who are on our side and I am not sure who can you trust.

You also need to check where are radiopharmaceuticals from these facilities sent. Clinics can be located anywhere else in your country.

Isotopes have short half life, so they are created non-stop and transported periodically. Cooperation at European level is required.

&amp;#x200B;

Governments of european countries and also others, it is clear to me that there are secret agreements around the existence of the cyclotron/synchrotron facilities to ensure the inviolability of these facilities, similar to embassies, do not try to cover up this problem.

I ask you on behalf of humanity to immediately declassify these documents and other information with whom the agreements were signed and which lobby groups are behind it.

If you refuse or hesitate for a long time, you will be judged in the future for helping crimes against humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to warn the authorities that the current vaccines that are already in your country may be harmless, but the Octopus plan can be that harmful substances will be added in other batches later. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce persistent monitoring of these vaccines by someone other than the pharmaceutical companies themselves. At the same time, I am asking for a complete identification of substances at the level of conventional medicines, like ibuprofen on wikipedia e.g.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen)

Where you can see the molecular structure of ibuprofen as well as the various chemical identifiers used to identify chemicals.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to draw your attention to the fact that the octopus management is aware that it can't feed this PR for a long time and will have to revive the corona in some way to really start dying a lot of people, I believe they can do it with those vaccines, but so far i think they testing society how much it can handle and to get more money.

Until I see the crowded cemeteries, I think we are still on the edge when we can intervene, action is needed immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also like to point out a fact, that the source material used in cyclotron and synchrotron facilities must be at first prepared in special reactors. From internet sources it is for europe mainly research reactor Petten in Netherlands.

Material is periodically sent from there to individual cyclo/synchrotron facilities in european countries. Then it is processed there to create individual isotopes and also prepared as radiopharmaceuticals.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petten\_nuclear\_reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petten_nuclear_reactor)

And dear EU government, EU council, and all you ladies and gentlemans in Brussel or other cities.

The reactor is property of European Comission, be aware. And from wikipedia it is operated by Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear\_Research\_and\_Consultancy\_Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Research_and_Consultancy_Group)

&amp;#x200B;

Some surprised new members of Octopus:

Stop being afraid and start writing and talking about it, threads need to be unraveled. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Media:

You have my permission to disclose this text in the original version (without correcture).

If you are connected to octopus, i propose you to ignore any other commands from octopus and you should stop writing anything about Corona as a protest and concentrate on this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

This organization lack moral values as justice, truth and honor.

I live in the European Union and the United Nations for which I believe are these moral values important and I was trusting them, but now I was disappointed in Western democracy, it is important to return to these moral values.

&amp;#x200B;

When I find out the truth a few days ago I was in shock and I had very sad instead of cheerful Christmas.

If humanity wants to handle the ecological crisis I propose a return of justice, more opennes, truth, humor and not artificial creation of fear of bad virus that does not even exist. Increasing the differences between the first percentages of the richest and the others is inadmissible.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that CO2 emissions have been reduced thanks to Corona is praise, but these crimes against humanity must be punished.

&amp;#x200B;

I propose members of the organization, if it will remain, to change their internal political system to sophocracy, the technocracy is clearly unattuded.

But I also refuse and I do not show interest in any way to join, work for you or make any decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

CORE OF OCTOPUS:

Since it reminds me of the chess game, I already has been thinking about your next step. You will try to take over of messages in the media with some unfairness type like terrorist attack and creating another fear. I have a horrical ideas about reappearing abuse of atomic or biological research and detonation of atomic bomb in some EU state or elsewhere in the world that fits some terrorist organization.

I ask you from dropping from such an intention. Give up voluntarily, it will be in your favor.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask other multinational corporations to confirm they are on our side and condemnation of these practices. The fact that withdrawals from the ATM are already limited to +-200 euros indicates to me the sad things dear financial corporations.

&amp;#x200B;

I propose that scientists and doctors who knew about the existence of nuclear medicine and about what it serves, but they were afraid of fear of talking about it, publicly stepped out, apologized and said they were sorry.

As a society we need such people, so it is important that they should not be afraid to talk about such practices. Scientists and doctors who knew what nuclear medicine is used for and send people to such examinations need to be judged.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to ask investigative journalists about proper documenting and investigative work. There are multiple types of nuc med examinations. For example, heart examination has the highest dose of radiation, I think that with this one patient dies on a heart attack within a few days or hours. For gammametry of skeleton i estimate a few months to death on leukemia or other type of death/cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your attention.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

The actions that you as people will do in the coming months and years will evaluate not only your children or grandchildren.

I dare to philosophize. Overgrowing and ecological problem on the planet afflict every developed civilization that missed the space colonization, it is important how we approach the problem. If there is any advenced civilisation outside, or if there are more of them and there is some community, know that our actions and form of society we build will be also evaluated by them. But do not beleive and do not hope that they will help us. 

Believe only in yourself.

“A quarter of our planet’s biodiversity is present in soil. This is literally a treasure under our feet, and our food and our future depend on it”, the Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Virginijus Sinkevičius declared. 

Regenerative agriculture is a set of farming principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches soils, improves watersheds, and enhances ecosystem services.

153,mlwwgw,europe,Greenlands green-left IA party apparent victors in yesterdays elections - breaking 42 years of rule by social democrats,25,1.0,1617780923,,0,"Greenlands has been ruled by center-left social democratic party Siumut almost without break since home-rule was established in 1979. Now the largest opposition party IA (Inuit Ataqatigiit) - a left-green party - seems poised to build the government. Neither party ruled out cooperation with the other, but other small parties are available to build a coalition.

The key issues dividing the two parties are

1. Establishing rare-mineral mining that would diversify the economy, but risk heavy pollution to nature (Siumit is for, IA is against). This also impacts Greenland's stance on the Paris Agreement on climate change to which Greenland is not currently signed up - but IA plans to join.
2. Independence from Denmark. Siumit wants to set a date, and prepare the economy (the mine being a big part of increasing revenues and becoming financially independent of Denmark). IA also wants independence, has no date, does not want to sacrifice nature to prepare economy for independence.

Tomorrow (Sunday, September 26), there will be a federal election in Germany.

**Electoral system**

Germany uses a [Mixed-Member Proportional Election System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation).

&gt; Germans elect their members of parliament with two votes. One vote is for a direct candidate, who ought to receive a plurality vote in their election district. The second vote (considered as more important) is to elect a party list in each province as established by its respective party caucus. Half of the Bundestag is then filled with candidates that won their electoral districts by the first votes and the other half by candidates from the party lists according roughly to the proportion the parties receive from the second votes according to a complex mathematical formula. Common practice is that direct candidates are also placed on the electoral lists at higher rankings as a fall-back if they do not win their districts.

[Taken from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Germany)


The voting ballots look like [this](https://www.bigge-online.de/cache/images/stories/aktuelles/2021/btw21/wahlzettel_bundestag_2021-1_500x805-equal.JPG)  - First vote (local representative) on the left, secondary vote (party setup of the parliament) on the right. 

--

As explained a while back in a post here on /r/europe, the [distribution of vote weight](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xv0o6/votes_per_seat_for_political_parties_in_selected/) in the German electoral system is extremely fair compared to other systems of voting.

--

There is a 5% threshold for making it into the parliament, hence 50% of the votes are not required for a majority. If 5% of the votes go to parties not represented in the parliament, 48% of the votes are enough to form a government as the 5% do not get seats in the parliament. If a party gets more than three direct mandates (first vote), the 5% threshold does not apply and the party will get seats according to their share of secondary votes in the parliament. If they get one or two direct mandates, they will get just these one or two seats. Any party reaching more than 0.5% in the election will receive state funding, roughly 1€ per vote.

**The Parties**

--

*Disclaimer: These summaries have no claim of being complete or exhaustive. Please do not make up your mind based on these summaries.*

For a more in-depth overview of the parties and their election programmes, [SEE HERE](https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-the-party-programs/a-59103401). 

*[CDU:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany)* Conservatives. The Party of Angela Merkel, the current chancellor. Led by [Armin Laschet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Laschet), the current prime minister of Germany's most populous state, North-Rhine-Westphalia. Wants tougher restrictions on asylum but is in favour of the concept of asylum in general. Wants to decrease taxes for people and companies and build more social housing. According to many observers, the CDU has failed to present a coherent program for Germany and focussed a significant part of their election campaign on attacking the other parties, warning of a ""left-turn"" of Germany.

--

*[CSU:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Social_Union_in_Bavaria)* The bavarian sister party of the CDU. Only runs in bavaria. Mostly on the same page as the CDU, but a bit more conservative, tougher on immigration, tries to give bavarian interests a greater say on the federal level. Is a bit sour that their leader wasn't selected as the joint CDU/CSU candidate for this election. 

--

*[SPD:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany)* Social Democrats. Lead by their chancellor candidate [Olaf Scholz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz), the current vice chancellor and minister of finance, who has been described as the ""most boring man of all boring germans"" by the New York times. The SPD campaigns on more social equality; they want to increase the minimum wage to 12€ an hour and reduce taxes for the lower 95% people and pay for it by increasing taxes for the top 5% plus implementing a wealth tax of 1% for the very rich. Are committed to keeping the pensions stable. They are committed to the goal of exiting coal by 2038 and disagree that this goal should be reached earlier. They want to introduce a 130 km/h speed limit on the *Autobahns* to decrease emissions. They also want to decrease the election age to 16. 

--

*[B/90 Die Grünen (Greens):](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens)* Environmentalists. Want to get the shares of renewables to 100% by 2030, want to ban the sale of all fossil-powered cars by 2030, they want to prohibit the export of weapons into the middle east and similar regions. They want to abolish mass livestock farming by 2037 and legalize Cannabis. They are also in favour of making all education free and increasing the life standard for the poor people in this country. Wants to increase taxes for the rich and provide more for the poor, including lowering taxes for them. Oppose the 2% NATO spending goal, but are in favour of NATO in general. Wants to limit the speed on the Autobahns to 130 km/h.

--

*[FDP:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_(Germany\))* Pro-market, liberal (in the european sense) party. After being part of the government between 2009-2013, they failed to make it into the parliament in 2013 (didn't reach the 5% threshold) but had a strong showing in the 2017 elections. Negotiated with CDU and Greens to form a government but eventually pulled out of the negotiations. Wants to implement a canadian-style immigration system and lower taxes for everyone. Wants to switch our pension system to the swedish model. 


--

*[Die LINKE (The Left):](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_(Germany\))* is a ""proper"" left-wing party. They want to increase the minimum wage and pensions, abolish sanctions in the social benefits system (so far you can get sanctioned if you are unemployed and refuse to meet your agency officer or refuse to take jobs), tax the rich. They are fundamentally anti-military and want to abolish NATO and are opposed to any deployments of our army. They want to partially nationalize or at least heavily regulate the banking sector and they want to put legal limits on how much rent people can charge for living space. Are in favour of laxer immigration rules and favour the ban of sales of fossil-powered cars while also advocating for a general 120 km/h speed limit on the *Autobahns*.

--

*[AfD:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany)* Right wing populists, conservatives. Originally created in the wake of the greek debt crisis as a eurosceptic party, they are mainly running on an anti-refugee, nationalist messaging today. They advocate for a europe of nation states and want germany to leave the Euro. Wants to drastically curb migration and wants Germany to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement since they do not believe in human-made climate change.

**Possible coalitions**


* *Grand Coalition (CDU/CSU-SPD|SPD-CDU/CSU):* The current government coalition, made up by the two major german parties. Irrespective of the result of the election rather unlikely since there is little appetite from either side to continue this, especially not from the SPD side. 

* *Jamaica (CDU/CSU-FDP-Greens):* A coalition of this kind is currently governing one of our states (Schleswig-Holstein). Would be the most-favoured coalition of the CDU, but there is little appetite in the green party to help the CDU to yet another term given that they are aiming for significant political change in Germany, which won't be accomplished with the CDU at the helm.


* *Red-red-green (SPD-Linke-Greens):* Majority is not secured, may or may not happen. Main Problem in this coalition are some positions of the LINKE, which include leaving NATO, which is unacceptable for the other two parties. 


* *Traffic Light Coalition (SPD-FDP-Greens):* Has a fairly comfortable majority at the moment, main problem are the ideological difference between the FDP and the other two parties, especially the greens. While SPD and Greens favour a stronger role of the state in combatting climate change, FDP favours market solutions. Income (and wealth) tax changes are also a strong point of dispute between the parties.

**Polling**



Party| CDU/CSU | SPD|  FDP | Greens | LINKE | AfD| Other

You can check the polling with the different polling agencies [here](http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/). Clicking on an agency will also give you a history of the polling. All institutes bar Allensbach and INSA rely on phone polling, INSA uses YouGov (online polling) and Allensbach is polling people in the streets.

**Schedule**

8am-6pm CEST: Voting 

6 pm: Exit polls

6:15-10 pm: Projections of the result

~10 pm: First official publication on the results of the first vote.

~3am: Official results for all votes

It is worth noticing that it is very rare that significant changes happen after 11pm, so the election will most likely be called by then.

first of all, I would like that this thread is carried on in a polite manner, so if you are here to shove your views of the world of someone who has never set foot outside of the Schengen area and can only spit on eastern Europe, please leave

Climate change is a problem, that's something we all know. We know that developed countries, including European ones, are not doing enough (source: climateactiontracker.org)
I often come across EU Commission posts on my fb timeline, for example, stating that the EU is striving to be the first carbon-neutral continent

Continent is a geopolitical term, so it wouldn't necessarily be incorrectly used in this case. There is one thing that makes me think a lot, though. The EU covers only around 40% of the European continent's surface, which, together with Oceania's, is the smallest on the planet (among the ""classic"" continents). The population is also small compared to the rest of the world

I therefore ask myself, why is the EU so closed, almost kind of hostile, to the idea of expanding itself to help other surrounding countries make the planet better? Nobody ever talks about it. Yet, the majority of the European surface is covered in countries whose infrastructure needs remordenisation also from an ecological point of view (even parts of many Eastern European countries need it)

I know, there are strict criteria to join the EU and everything, but being happy to have a very clean country next to one of the most polluted ones in the continent (Balkans) is not a win. More has to be achieved, because the gap between rich and poor countries can get deeper, and probably already is

Why is this not being taken seriously? If more countries are not let in, like Ukraine, Turkey or the Balkans, they will continue polluting. A restricted club of ~30 rich countries will stay comfortable while the rest will just ruin all the hard work (not intentionally, of course, but because nobody ever did anything to help them, and their pollution will cancel the EU's hard work)
This is also a great advantage that the 2004 EU expansion brought if you ask me. It's easy to be strong and rich in a small group of elite countries without doing the dirty work to help the nearby countries get better and actually achieve something way bigger together 

There is a lot to be politically done in said countries, that's for sure and not at all to be underrated. But we also need to see the matter from the other side. If the EU does not bring change there, probably nothing will

I am not aware of already existing plans on behalf of the EU to help fight climate change in third countries, but if there are, I'd be glad to know",[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/eepjc3/enlarging_the_eu_for_the_climate/,1

i want to start from separating Co2 emissions from climate change, from my point of view those things are related but different problems. I do think there can be ways to reduce and even go negative on the Co2 yet still have climate change and temperature increases

I and you are a ""machine"" that transforms chemicals energy and emit around 100Watts per day in heat, my phone does that to, fridge, washer, PC, AC, heating, everything that uses energy radiates heat because energy is never lost just transformed, cities have this problem and [urban heat is a thing](https://e360.yale.edu/features/urban-heat-can-white-roofs-help-cool-the-worlds-warming-cities)

Solar panels are just devices that transforms energy, so even if 100% of energy come from solar(plus other green sources) all that end in a device that radiates heat

Today on February 8th, 2020 there is a general election in the Republic of Ireland to elect members to the lower house and principal chamber of the Irish Parliament, the [Dáil Éireann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann). 

***

##History &amp; Background:

Since Ireland gained independence in 1922, politics has been dominated by two major parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. These parties see their origins in the [Irish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Civil_War) (1922-23) when the Sinn Féin party split over the terms of the [Anglo-Irish Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty), which ended the [Irish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence) (1919-21). These two parties have led every government since independence.

In the 2011 election, in the shadow of the financial crisis of 2007-08, of which Ireland was hit particularly hard with a domestic banking crisis and recession, the ruling Fianna Fáil government collapsed from 71 seats to 20, suffering the worst electoral defeat in the history of the State, with Fine Gael sweeping the polls to become the largest party, in addition to substantial gains for the Labour Party and Sinn Féin. A coalition government between Fine Gael and Labour was formed.

In the 2016 election, Fine Gael kept its position as the largest party, but went from 66 seats to 50. It's coalition partner, Labour, collapsed from 37 seats to 7. Fianna Fáil recovered to become the second largest party, going from 21 seats to 44, while Sinn Féin made strong gains, going from 14 seats to 23. A minority government was formed by a coalition of Fine Gael and a number of Independents, supported by a confidence and supply agreement with Fianna Fáil. Then in June 2017, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny stood down and was replaced by Leo Varadkar, with his competitor for the position Simon Coveney becoming Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister).


***

##Voting System:

In Ireland, the constitution mandates that an election must be held at least every seven years, while statue law has reduced this number to five years. The country is divided into [39 districts](https://i.imgur.com/kairBRw.png) that elect 3, 4 or 5 TD's (Teachta Dála; equivalent to Member of Parliament (MP) or Member of Congress), with the constitution mandating one TD must represent no less than 20,000 people, but no more than 30,000 people. The Dáil consists of 160 TD's, in this election 159 will be elected, while the Ceann Comhairle (Chairman/Speaker of the Dáil) is re-elected automatically.

TD's are elected through a system of **Multi-Member Constituency Proportional Representation by way of Single Transferable Vote.** This system works as follows...

* The voter marks their ballot card in order of preference. This means putting a number one beside your favourite candidate, then a two beside your second-favourite, and so on down the ballot. You do not have to fill in all of the spaces.
* When it comes to counting, only one of your preferences is active at any one time. This starts with your number one.
* If the candidate you have marked as your number one, or first preference, is eliminated or else is elected without needing your vote (ie, they have already met the quota, or minimum level of votes required), then attention turns to your second preference. The quota is calculated based on the number of seats and the number of valid votes cast in that constituency.
* If the candidate is still running (ie has not been eliminated or elected yet), then your vote for them is counted.
* If your second preference candidate has already been eliminated or elected before counting your vote, then attention turns to your third preference.
* This continues down the line until all available seats in that constituency have been filled or all your preferences have been considered.

This system allows elections in Ireland to avoid the pitfalls of systems such as First Past The Post (FPTP) with the percentages of votes cast for particular parties often aligning closely with their percentage of seats in the Dáil. Tactical voting for candidates more likely to win, ""splitting the vote"", or the ""spoiler effect"" are effectively non-existent under this system. Voting in Ireland is done using pencil on paper ballots that are then counted by hand by public servants in large centres across the country. These centres are open to the public to allow transparency and engagement with the democratic process.

#Parties:

 - **Fianna Fail:** Much like Canada's Liberal Party or Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, Fianna Fail could be understood as Ireland's ""natural governing party"". The party has historically dominated the politics of the country, having ruled either alone or in coalition for approximately 61 years of the 98 Ireland has been independent. Fianna Fail is a big-tent, catch-all party, navigating the centre ground of Irish politics, although with a distinct lean towards the centre-right. It can reasonably be labelled ""populist"", having a greater tendency for market intervention than its main competitor, although it is also more conservative socially, albeit not extremely. Fianna Fail also advertises itself as a nationalist and republican party, more dedicated to the ambition of a United Ireland than its competitor. The party is Pro-EU and a member of the centrist ""Renew"" EU Parliament party. [Party Manifesto](https://www.fiannafail.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fianna-Fail-General-Election-Manifesto-2020.pdf)

 - **Fine Gael:** The current ruling party and historically second most popular party in Ireland, Fine Gael also inhabits the centre-ground, although with some differences. Fine Gael is a liberal-conservative/Christian democratic party; generally being more in favour of market liberalism and ""fiscal rectitude"" than its main competitor, while also leaning towards a somewhat more progressive social policy, facilitating referendums during their governance on marriage equality, legalisation of abortion, removal of vestigial Blasphemy laws, and liberalising requirements for divorce, issues that enjoyed support across most major parties. The party further presents itself as the party of ""law and order"", resisting physical force methods and being ""tough on crime"". Fine Gael is generally less overtly ""nationalist"" than its main competitor, while also being more Internationalist and Pro-EU, being a founding member of the European People's Party (EPP). [Party Manifesto](https://election2020.finegael.ie/pdf/FG_GE20_Manifesto.pdf)

 - **Sinn Féin:** An all-island and nationalist-republican party, the primary political aim of Sinn Féin is the reunification of Ireland into a single sovereign state. It is debatably Ireland's oldest active political party (est. 1905), however the party today was more accurately formed in 1970 after a splintering. Currently third largest in the Dáil, Sinn Féin is a left to hard-left, democratic socialist and populist party. It has never been in government nor served as Leader of the Opposition, only first entering the Dáil (post-1970) in 1997 and the two largest parties refusing coalition with it. The party generally supports higher levels of taxation to fund social services, generous expansion of free healthcare availability, large housing project construction, and rent freezes. On social issues the party has been supportive of LGBT rights, although is moderate/mixed on abortion. A member of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left EU Parliamentary party, Sinn Féin has historically been a soft-Eurosceptic party, although in light of Brexit this stance has softened somewhat. [Party Manifesto](https://www.sinnfein.ie/files/2020/SF_GE2020_Manifesto.pdf)

 - **Labour:** Ireland's oldest continuous political party (est. 1912), Labour is a centre-left social democratic party with strong historical and contemporary ties to Irish labour movements, trade unions, and worker groups. Often the bridesmaid, Labour has on many occasions served as the junior coalition partner in Irish governments, most often and most recently with Fine Gael in 2011. The harsh realities of this coalition government during a time of recession resulted in unpopular decisions, most controversially conceding to an increase in College registration fees after campaigning on reducing them. Going from their best result in 2011 to their worst collapse in 2016, the parties current policies and campaign centre around re-establishing itself as the principal left-wing party of the country, proposing large investment in housing, a national living wage, free GP care for under 18s, few tax cut ""giveaways"" and constitutional reform. Once hesitant, the party is now strongly pro-EU and a member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats EU Parliamentary party. [Party Manifesto](https://www.labour.ie/download/pdf//labour_manifesto_web.pdf)

 - **Solidarity–People Before Profit:** An electoral triumvirate of three separate parties (**Solidarity**, **People Before Profit** and **RISE**), this alliances divisions are admittedly born mostly out of the narcissism of small differences. Broadly the parties are all left to far-left Democratic Socialists, Trotskyites and Anti-Capitalists, campaigning on bold election policies such as a constitutional right to housing, national rent freezes, abolishing the HSE (national health service) in favour of devolved, regional health centres, all public transport to be free and free tertiary education. The alliance is soft-Eurosceptic and aligns itself with no party of the European Parliament, although it is a member of the European Anti-Capitalist Left. [Party Manifesto](https://manifesto.pbp.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/People-Before-Profit-General-Election-Manifesto-2020.pdf)

 - **Green Party:** Once a kingmaker, now rebuilding itself, the Green Party are a centre-left and environmentalist party with a natural emphasis on sustainability, climate change and biodiversity. The party first entered a coalition in 2007 with Fianna Fáil, but was wiped out in 2011, losing all its seats and recovering only 2 in 2016. Much like Labour they are cautious to not again be mangled and spat out by the machinery of coalitions with larger parties. While emphasising the pressing urgency of the climate crisis, their tone is influenced by the more immediate domestic issues of housing, homelessness and health, framing controversial (but in their view necessary) policies such as carbon taxes and culling the national beef herd by their potential economic benefits. Standout policies include universal basic income, ""Portugal style"" drug policies, a constitutional amendment on the public ownership of water, and a wealth tax for people with assets over €10 million. The party is pro-EU and a member of the Greens–European Free Alliance EU Parliamentary party. [Party Manifesto](https://www.greenparty.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GP-manifesto-2020-FINAL.pdf)

 - **Social Democrats:** Recent newcomers to the Irish political scene, the Social Democrats are a centre-left social democratic party strongly inspired by the ""Nordic Model"" of Scandinavian nations. The party covers much the same political grounds as the Labour Party, though perhaps somewhat more left, particularly on social issues. While only holding 2 seats in the Dáíl, the flagship policy of the party has been ""Sláintecare"", a large structural reform of the Irish healthcare system to bring it in line with its European neighbours by creating a universal single-tiered health service. This policy has become consensus amongst most of the Dáil, although implementation is yet to be seen and may vary. The party is pro-EU but has no representation nor alliance to any party in the European Parliament. [Party Manifesto](https://www.socialdemocrats.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Invest-in-Better-GE2020-31-Jan.pdf)


###Smaller Parties/Others:

 - **Aontú:** Currently a party of one, Aontú was created after a TD for Sinn Féin left due to his anti-abortion views while the party whipped in favour of legislation setting out acceptable circumstances for abortion. The party is socially conservative, particularly on abortion, while more left on economic issues, also inheriting aspirations of Irish unity from Sinn Féín. The party currently does not poll high enough to receive state funding, be prompted in most opinion polls, nor appear in televised party debates. The party is soft-Eurosceptic.

 - **Renua:** Currently without a leader or elected representative at any level, Renua is a centre-right to right socially conservative and economically liberal party with strong anti-abortion positions. The party was formed after a Fine Gael TD lost the party whip after voting against legislation to allow abortion in event of risk to the mothers life, including risk of suicide. The party is soft-Eurosceptic.

 - **Independents:** Due to the PR-STV system and highly localised nature of politics in the country, Ireland hosts an unusually high level of Independent TD's in its parliament, not associated with any political party. Independents currently make up 19/160 seats in the Dáil, and are often vital in pushing a coalition government over the majority required.

 - **Independents:** Due to the PR-STV system and highly localised nature of politics in the country, Ireland hosts an unusually high level of Independent TD's in its parliament, not associated with any political party. Independents currently make up 19/160 seats in the Dáil, and are often vital in pushing a coalition government over the majority required.

359,fhjzo8,europe,Coronavirus. A note from A German.,0,,1584033984,,0,"Hi everyone, 

  
currently sitting in self-inflicted quarantine in Germany, reading the news from all around the world. I can see there are a lot of dark humor and corona-memes going around; but also despair, axiety and anger. All all of those feelings are justified. Sitting here quietly by mself, I know there's nothing I can do but to watch how things are unfoldings and sit things out - It's as sure as the sun that my country is going to get rekt in the next days. 

I think that I do not only speak for myself when I say: We are also thinking about what's going on in other countries. We are feeling with the Italians, Iranians, Greeks and whoever else is in trouble right now. We wish there was more that we could do or contribute at this point. I think that we should help American's and other travellers that are now stranded over here in Europe and are maybe running out of cash or struggle to find shelter. And no one I know is getting any kicks out of blaming the Chinese, even though some idiots over at r/sino like to pretend that we are just horrible people; now they're having foam running out of their mouths as that they see that Europe is not ideally handling this situation and that people are dying. Fact is, the racism against asian people is ugly and I think the way our neighbors and guests from asian countries are currently treated is despicable. To top this shitcake, the global economy is tanking, it will take a while to sort out the aftermath of this colossal, epochal goatfuck that was Corona 2020. 

I hope that if there is any sort of conclusion to be drawn from this pandemic, it's that the world is a very small place. And that local issue can quickly become anyone's problem. I hope that this event will not lead to the EU, the world becoming more fragmented and hostile.  This pandemic is just a taste of what's waiting for us if when the effects of climate change are starting to become more apparent. We should really start to work together and solve our problems. Or our problems are starting to sort us out by themselves.

368,g5i1ta,europe,"/r/Europe, what are your views on some of the major issues affecting our society today?",33,,1587485344,,0,"First of all, I'd like to start with a disclaimer: I am highly biased *against* the European Union.

In an attempt to better understand my own shortcomings and maybe change my mind on some parts, I would very much appreciate to know (you all) your opinions on a number of questions outlined below. They are not absolute: feel free to elaborate on any one of them, skip some, deviate from the question if it feels necessary, and of course try your best to explain *why* or *why not* you hold a particular view.

But first, [here are the results](http://data.fondapol.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/English.xlsx) of a large poll conducted on a European scale by a French think-tank (in English) on democracy in general: it might be of interest to you.

And now, the questions:

 - What are, in your own opinion, the major issues that the ""Western world"" is facing today? (e.g. China, Russia, the fake news, populism, climate change, wealth inequalities, ...)

 - **What is, according to you, the primary goal of the European Union (EU)?** If your answer is merely ""cooperation"", could you elaborate? Is the current form of the EU institutions the *only* way to achieve such cooperation in Europe?
    - See [the website of the EU](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/history_en) for a brief review of its history
    - See the [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/) for an example of non-EU organization at a European level

 - Are you satisfied with the current form of the EU? Why? Why not? How then could the EU be improved? What is it ""lacking"" at the moment? What should be removed?

 - Would you support, in the long run, the dissolution of individual states in favor of a single federal EU government?

 - Why do you think there hasn't been a ""major"" conflict on European ground for the past 70 years?
    - See the Wikipedia article on [Democratic Peace Theory (DPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory)
    - See the Wikipedia article on [the Yugoslav Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars)

 - **How do you feel about populism?** I'm writing in bold this one as well, because I would be very interested by your answer. How would you define it? Is it a good thing, a bad thing? Who is a ""populist"", according to your own definition? **Why is populism on the rise in the Western block?**
    - See [this lengthy article from *the Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/14/anti-populism-politics-why-champions-of-civility-keep-losing) on why the ""moderates"" seem to keep losing to populism
    - See [the rest of *the Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-new-populism) for general spam on the dangers of populism

 - What about democracy, do you think it is important? What does it mean to you? What is *not* democratic, in your views? Are we living in democracies in the Western world, according to your definition?

 - What is your social status (upper-class, middle-class, ...)? Do you work in the services sector? Have you travelled abroad often in your life? How does all the previous points affect your views on the EU, in your opinion? Do the people in your social circles share your views on the EU? Why? Why not?

 - Would you label yourself as an *optimist*? *progressive*? *realist*? *pragmatic*? *liberal*? *nihilist*? *europhile*?

 - Do you value science in decision-making? Do you work in a STEM field? How do you think the general scientific ""advancement"" is structured? Do you hold a particular view in the philosophy of science?

 - **Would you rather only let experts make decisions in your country?** Would you, in the long run, support a society governed by a single A.I.?

 - What are your views on NATO? WTO? UN? IMF?

 - To what extent would you be ready to act against the rise of populism? and against the end of the EU?

 - What is your opinion on the ""mainstream"" media? Would you say that they are biased? Do you read the newspapers often, nonetheless? **How do you perceive the issue of the *fake news* spreading?** How are they, if at all, related to the mainstream media, according to you?
    - See the evolution of [the search interest for ""fake news"" on Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%22fake%20news%22)
    - See the [2019 Reuters Digital News Report](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/DNR_2019_FINAL.pdf)


 - Do you think that merely being *right*, or having the rational answer to a problem, or having the law on your side is enough to tackle any challenge, no matter how big? (*""Eventually, the truth comes out""*)

 - In all honesty, what do you think of the people disagreeing, or not seeing eye to eye with you on any of the aforementioned issues? Do you despise them? Consider them uneducated? Misinformed?

 - How this could be changed? **How would convince others that your opinion is right?**

I think the reason we need a federation is because we have to work together and cooperate to solve problems in the world. We have to protect each other. We have to fight terrorism and economic issues. We have to protect our environment and our rights. We have to work together to stop climate change and protect our environment. We have to protect our democracy. We have to protect our values of freedom, equality, democracy, human rights, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.

This is just a theory, but I think we need a federation to make sure that we don't get distracted from our main goal, which is to protect each other and work together to solve problems.

396,io5qr3,europe,Netherlands to Invest $24 Billion in Economy With Delayed Fund,9,1.0,1599477956,,0," 

The Netherlands is set to invest billions of euros in its economy, carrying out a plan announced several months before the coronavirus outbreak worsened the outlook.

The Dutch government plans to spend 20 billion euros ($24 billion) over five years to improve its infrastructure and spur research and development, according to a statement Monday. This money, which will be allocated by a national investment fund, will help address an aging population, climate change and low productivity growth.

The move, outlined a year ago, is another step away from an era of austerity in the Netherlands. To soften the impact of the pandemic, the government has helped prop up companies including Air France-KLM and by the end of July, it had earmarked 37 billion euros for this year to finance emergency measures.

“We need to act now if we’re going to achieve sustainable earnings capacity for the future,” Economic Affairs Minister Eric Wiebes said at a press conference in Amsterdam.

New national elections are due to be held in the Netherlands in March 2021.

An independent commission will be tasked with reviewing investment proposals. Members will include Prince Constantijn, ING Groep NV Chief Economist Marieke Blom, and former Eurogroep head Jeroen Dijsselbloem.

The government may extend the program beyond five years, Wiebes and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said at the briefing. If that’s the case, it would aim to keep investing around 4 billion euros a year.

The events of recent weeks in mainland and overseas France  have deeply disturbed the nation. They have mixed legitimate demands with a series of unacceptable acts of violence and I want to tell you right away that these acts of violence will not benefit from any indulgence.

We have all seen the game of opportunists who have tried to take advantage of sincere anger to mislead them. We have all seen the irresponsible politicians whose only plan was to shake up the Republic, seeking disorder and anarchy. There is no anger to justify attacking a police officer, a gendarme, a business or public buildings. Our freedom exists only because everyone can express their opinions, others can not share them without anyone having to be afraid of these disagreements.

When violence breaks out, freedom ceases. It is therefore now time for calm and republican order to prevail. We will do everything in our power to do so, because nothing will be built in a sustainable way as long as there are fears for civil peace. I have given the government the most rigorous instructions in this regard.

But at the beginning of all this, I do not forget that there is anger, indignation. And this indignation, many of us, many French people can share it and I do not want to reduce it to the unacceptable behaviour I have just denounced.

It was first the anger against a tax and the Prime Minister responded by cancelling and removing all the increases planned for early next year but this anger is deeper, I feel it is fair in many ways. It can be our chance.

It is the one of the couple of employees who do not finish the month and get up early every day and come back late to work far away.

It is that of a single mother, widowed or divorced, who no longer even lives, who cannot afford childcare and improve her ends of the month and no longer has any hope. I saw them, these women of courage for the first time saying this distress on so many roundabouts!

It is that of modest retirees who have contributed all their lives and often help both parents and children and do not get away with it.

It is that of the most vulnerable, of people with disabilities whose place in society is not yet sufficiently recognised. Their distress was not new, but we had finally got used to it and deep down, everything was happening as if they were forgotten, erased.

Forty years of unease have resurfaced: the unease of workers who no longer find their way around; the unease of territories, villages and neighbourhoods where public services are being reduced and the living environment disappears; the democratic unease where the feeling of not being heard is developing; the unease of changes in our society, of a shaken secularism and of lifestyles that create barriers and distance.

It comes from a long way away, but it's there now.

We have probably not been able to provide a sufficiently rapid and strong response for a year and a half. I take my part in this responsibility. I may have given you the feeling that it was not my concern, that I had other priorities. I also know that I have hurt some of you with my words. I want to be very clear with you tonight. If I have fought to shake up the political system in place, the habits, the hypocrisies, it is precisely because I believe more than anything in our country and I love it and my legitimacy, I do not take it from any title, any party, any coterie; I only take it from you, from anyone else.

Many other countries are going through the same difficulty to live that is ours, but I deeply believe that we can find a way out of it together. I want this for France because it is our vocation throughout history to open up paths that have never been explored for ourselves and for the world.

I want this for all of us French people because a people that is so divided, that no longer respects its laws and the friendship that must unite it, is a people that is running to its death.

I also want it because it was by anticipating this crisis that I ran for your vote, to reconcile and unite, and that I did not forget this commitment and this necessity.

First of all, I want to declare a state of economic and social emergency today. We want to build a France of merit, of work, of a France where our children will live better than we do. This can only be achieved through better schools, universities, apprenticeships and training that teach the youngest and oldest what it takes to live free and work.

The investment in the Nation, in school and training is unprecedented and I confirm it.

We want a France where people can live with dignity from their work. On this point, we went too slowly. I want to intervene quickly and concretely on this subject. I ask the government and Parliament to do what is necessary to ensure that we can live better from our work early next year. The salary of a worker at the SMIC (minimum wage) will increase by 100 euros per month from 2019 without costing the employer one more euro.

I want to get back with a fair idea: that the extra work accepted constitutes extra income; overtime will be paid without taxes or social contributions from 2019. And I want a real improvement to be immediately noticeable; that's why I will ask all employers who can, to pay an end-of-year bonus to their employees and this bonus will not have to pay any taxes or social contributions.

Retired people are a precious part of our Nation. For those who receive less than 2,000 euros per month, we will cancel in 2019 the increase in CSG (a special income tax that funds Social Security) suffered this year; the effort they were asked to make was too great and it was not fair. As of tomorrow, the Prime Minister will present all these decisions to parliamentarians.

But we must not stop there. I need our big companies, our wealthiest citizens, to help the Nation succeed; I will bring them together and make decisions to that end this week. I know that some people would like me to come back to the reform of the wealth tax in this context, but for almost 40 years it has existed; were we living better during that period? The richest people were leaving and our country was getting weaker. In accordance with the commitments made to you, this tax has been abolished for those who invest in our economy and thus help to create jobs; on the contrary, it has been maintained for those who have real estate assets.

Going back would weaken us at a time when we are recreating jobs in all sectors. However, the government and Parliament will have to go further to put an end to undue benefits and tax evasion. The manager of a French company must pay his taxes in France and the large companies that make profits there must pay taxes, that is simple justice.

As you can see, we will respond to the economic and social emergency with strong measures, faster tax cuts, better control of spending rather than setbacks.

I intend the government to pursue the ambition of the transformations of our country that the people chose 18 months ago; we have before us a profound reform of the State, unemployment benefits and pensions. They are essential. We want fairer, simpler, clearer rules that reward those who work.

But today, it is also with our collective project that we must renew. For France and for Europe. That is why the announced national debate must be much broader. To do this, we must first of all, assume all our duties together. The duty to produce in order to be able to redistribute, the duty to learn in order to be a free citizen, the duty to change in order to take into account the urgency of our climate and budgetary debt.

To succeed, we must come together and address all the issues essential to the Nation. I want the questions that concern representation to be asked; the possibility of a better understanding of the diversity of opinion, a fairer electoral law, the consideration of the blank vote and even the admission of non-party citizens to participate in the debate. I want to ask the question of the balance of our taxation so that it allows both justice and efficiency in the country. I want the question of our daily lives to be asked in order to face climate change: housing, travel and heating. And the right solutions will also emerge from the field.

I want to ask the question of the organization of the State, the way it is governed and administered from Paris, probably too centralized for decades. And the question of public service in all our territories.

I also want us to agree with the Nation itself on what its deep identity is, to address the issue of immigration. We have to face it.

These fundamental changes, which require profound and shared reflection, require an unprecedented debate. It must take place at national level in our institutions, everyone will have their part to play: government, assemblies, social partners and associations; you will have your part to play. I want to coordinate it myself, receive advice from it, and thus take the living pulse of our country.

But such a debate is not only a matter for institutional representatives; it must also take place everywhere on the ground and there are natural interlocutors, citizens who must receive requests and act as relays: they are the mayors; they bring the Republic to the field. That is why I will meet myself with the mayors of France, region by region, to build the foundation of our new contract for the Nation.

We will not return to the normal course of our lives, as too often in the past in similar crises, without anything really being understood and without anything changing. We are at a historic moment for our country: through dialogue, respect and commitment, we will succeed.

We are at work and I will come back to you to report back to you.

My only concern is you; my only fight is for you.

Our only battle is for France.

Long live the Republic, long live France. »

467,am0bko,europe,How about an European memorial day for the victims of war and famine?,5,,1549012946,,0,"Just thinking about this...

It is just one hundred eighty years ago since there was the Great Famine in Ireland. One million people died, while their country was still exporting food to their rich neighbour.

Eighty-five years ago, there was Holodomor, a man-made famine in Ukraine and the Soviet Union, where more than seven million people died.

Seventy-six years ago, there was the famine in Greece, where three hundred thousand people died as a result of war, plundering, and occupation.

How about an European memorial day for the victims of war and famine?

There are two points which I think this might be a good idea.

One is that in the last time, nationalism and threats of violence are on the rise. Attitudes and energies which caused these disasters - ignorance, fear out of ignorance, hate out of fear, unreal needs to feel superior, lust for power and sheer greed - are alive again, to a part because people don't believe that what happened many times in history could happen to them today. And these events and countries that I mentioned are again in different ways parts of conflict and dangerous power plays in Europe today.

I think that we people in Europe should reflect where we coming from, and we should see what we have achieved, also considering what was the past, and how we want our future. I think it is a good time for a joint remembrance of all these victims. The sadness about all these things in the past is something we have in common.

The second point is that humanity has a real, very big and dangerous challenge, which is climate change. This looks like a real threat to human civilization, and many people feel helpless and deeply scared about it. And the forces which keep us back are very similar to these which led to the nightmares of the past.

I think that when we remember what we have overcome and achieved in the past, people might see better that we are more than able to embrace that challenge. If we can overcome famine, can build space stations, and can go to the moon, we also can overcome climate change.",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/am0bko/how_about_an_european_memorial_day_for_the/,1

It will be held in order to be noticed from newspapers and medias who can finally bring the extreme urgent issue of Climate Change to the attention of world's leaders.

There probably already is a FridaysForFuture movement near you and if there isn't found one yourself!!!

493,axs2yd,europe,Emmanuel Macron’s letter to European citizens,1,,1551830155,,0,"Citizens of Europe,


If I am taking the liberty of addressing you directly, it is not only in the name of the history and values that unite us. It is because time is of the essence. In a few weeks' time, the European elections will be decisive for the future of our continent.
Never, since the Second World War, has Europe been as essential. Yet never has Europe been in so much danger.


Brexit stands as the symbol of that. It symbolises the crisis of Europe, which has failed to respond to its peoples' needs for protection from the major shocks of the modern world. It also symbolises the European trap. The trap is not being part of the European Union. The trap is in the lie and the irresponsibility that can destroy it. Who told the British people the truth about their post-Brexit future? Who spoke to them about losing access to the European market? Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the former border? Nationalist retrenchment offers nothing; it is rejection without an alternative. And this trap threatens the whole of Europe: the anger mongers, backed by fake news, promise anything and everything.


We have to stand firm, proud and lucid, in the face of this manipulation and say first of all what Europe is. It is a historic success: the reconciliation of a devastated continent in an unprecedented project of peace, prosperity and freedom. We should never forget that. And this project continues to protect us today. What country can act on its own in the face of aggressive strategies by the major powers? Who can claim to be sovereign, on their own, in the face of the digital giants? How would we resist the crises of financial capitalism without the euro, which is a force for the entire European Union? Europe is also those thousands of projects daily that have changed the face of our regions: the school refurbished, the road built, and the long-awaited arrival of high-speed Internet access. This struggle is a daily commitment, because Europe, like peace, can never be taken for granted. I tirelessly pursue it in the name of France to take Europe forward and defend its model. We have shown that what we were told was unattainable, the creation of a European defence capability and the protection of social rights, was in fact possible.

 
Yet we need to do more and sooner, because there is the other trap: the trap of the status quo and resignation. Faced with the major crises in the world, citizens so often ask us, 'Where is Europe? What is Europe doing?' It has become a soulless market in their eyes. Yet Europe is not just a market. It is a project. A market is useful, but it should not detract from the need for borders that protect and values that unite. The nationalists are misguided when they claim to defend our identity by withdrawing from Europe, because it is the European civilisation that unites, frees and protects us. But those who would change nothing are also misguided, because they deny the fears felt by our peoples, the doubts that undermine our democracies. We are at a pivotal moment for our continent, a moment when together we need to politically and culturally reinvent the shape of our civilisation in a changing world. It is the moment for European renewal. Hence, resisting the temptation of isolation and divisions, I propose we build this renewal together around three ambitions: freedom, protection and progress.


The European model is based on the freedom of man and the diversity of opinions and creation. Our first freedom is democratic freedom: the freedom to choose our leaders as foreign powers seek to influence our vote at each election. I propose creating a European Agency for the Protection of Democracies, which will provide each Member State with European experts to protect their election process against cyber attacks and manipulation. In this same spirit of independence, we should also ban the funding of European political parties by foreign powers. We should have European rules banish all incitements to hate and violence from the Internet, since respect for the individual is the bedrock of our civilisation of dignity.
Founded on internal reconciliation, the European Union has forgotten to look at the realities of the world. Yet no community can create a sense of belonging if it does not have bounds that it protects. The boundary is freedom in security. We therefore need to rethink the Schengen area: all those who want to be part of it should comply with obligations of responsibility (stringent border controls) and solidarity (one asylum policy with the same acceptance and refusal rules). We will need a common border force and a European asylum office, strict control obligations and European solidarity to which each country will contribute under the authority of a European Council for Internal Security. On the issue of migration, I believe in a Europe that protects both its values and its borders.


The same standards should apply to defence. Substantial progress has been made in the last two years, but we need to set a clear course: a treaty on defence and security should define our fundamental obligations in association with NATO and our European allies: increased defence spending, a truly operational mutual defence clause, and the European Security Council with the United Kingdom on board to prepare our collective decisions.


Our borders also need to guarantee fair competition. What power in the world would accept continued trade with those who respect none of their rules? We cannot suffer in silence. We need to reform our competition policy and reshape our trade policy with penalties or a ban in Europe on businesses that compromise our strategic interests and fundamental values such as environmental standards, data protection and fair payment of taxes; and the adoption of European preference in strategic industries and our public procurement, as our American and Chinese competitors do.


Europe is not a second-rank power. Europe in its entirety is a vanguard: it has always defined the standards of progress. In this, it needs to drive forward a project of convergence rather than competition: Europe, where social security was created, needs to introduce a social shield for all workers, east to west and north to south, guaranteeing the same pay in the same workplace, and a minimum European wage appropriate to each country and discussed collectively every year.


Getting back on track with progress also concerns spearheading the ecological cause. Will we be able to look our children in the eye if we do not also clear our climate debt? The European Union needs to set its target – zero carbon by 2050 and pesticides halved by 2025 – and adapt its policies accordingly with such measures as a European Climate Bank to finance the ecological transition, a European food safety force to improve our food controls and, to counter the lobby threat, independent scientific assessment of substances hazardous to the environment and health. This imperative needs to guide all our action: from the Central Bank to the European Commission, from the European budget to the Investment Plan for Europe, all our institutions need to have the climate as their mandate.


Progress and freedom are about being able to live from your work: Europe needs to look ahead to create jobs. This is why it needs not only to regulate the digital giants by putting in place European supervision of the major platforms (prompt penalties for unfair competition, transparent algorithms, etc.), but also to finance innovation by giving the new European Innovation Council a budget on a par with the United States in order to spearhead new technological breakthroughs such as artificial intelligence.
A world-oriented Europe needs to look towards Africa, with which we should enter into a covenant for the future, taking the same road and ambitiously and non-defensively supporting African development with such measures as investment, academic partnerships and education for girls.


Freedom, protection and progress. We need to build European renewal on these pillars. We cannot let nationalists without solutions exploit the people's anger. We cannot sleepwalk through a diminished Europe. We cannot become ensconced in business as usual and wishful thinking. European humanism demands action. And everywhere, the people are standing up to be part of that change. So by the end of the year, let's set up, with the representatives of the European institutions and the Member States, a Conference for Europe in order to propose all the changes our political project needs, with an open mind, even to amending the treaties. This conference will need to engage with citizens' panels and hear academics, business and labour representatives, and religious and spiritual leaders. It will define a roadmap for the European Union that translates these key priorities into concrete actions. There will be disagreement, but is it better to have a static Europe or a Europe that advances, sometimes at different paces, and that is open to all?


In this Europe, the peoples will really take back control of their future. In this Europe, the United Kingdom, I am sure, will find its true place.


Citizens of Europe, the Brexit impasse is a lesson for us all. We need to escape this trap and make the upcoming elections and our project meaningful. It is for you to decide whether Europe and the values of progress that it embodies are to be more than just a passing episode in history. This is the choice I propose: to chart together the road to European renewal.

&amp;#x200B;

The Europeans like their organic food, the protection of natural areas and the latest sustainable technologies.

We all want clean food, clean water and clean air. Will this emotional desire for the more clean and natural environment lead to the change in European politics ?

&amp;#x200B;

During the national elections everybody votes for their own local issues. The European election could be more about the global issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Are the Europeans ready to vote for the Green Parties in their multi-country elections ?

634,chnndn,europe,"Hi Europe! Considering that the main culprit for these worsening heatwaves is Climate Change, here's something you can do.",2,,1564061232,,0,"Have you heard about the Carbon Fee and Dividend act that's being discussed in America? It should be discussed here too! 

Here's what the Citizen's Climate Lobby (CCL) in Europe are advocating for:

&amp;#x200B;

**Carbon Fee**

&amp;#x200B;

This policy puts a fee on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. It starts low, and grows steadily over time. This will drive down carbon pollution because companies, industries, the public sector and consumers will move toward cleaner, cheaper options. It would start low, increasing in time, in order to give companies time to adjust and invest in more sustainable energy sources.

&amp;#x200B;

**Carbon Dividend**

&amp;#x200B;

The money collected from the carbon fee is returned every month to citizens to spend as they see fit. Program administrative costs are paid from the fees collected. Governments do not keep any of the money from the carbon fee.

&amp;#x200B;

**Border Carbon Adjustment**

&amp;#x200B;

Border Carbon Adjustments protect EU manufacturers and jobs from unfair international competition that lacks a carbon price. Imported goods will pay a border carbon adjustment, and goods exported from the EU will receive a refund under this policy.

&amp;#x200B;

 **More info about the initiative here:**

It is time for the **commercial animal agriculture and commercial fishing industry** to MAN UP and call it as it is - they **destroy nature** at a scale no other human activity is even capable of. **Ecocide, deforestation, desertification, biodiversity annihilation, soil erosion, extinction of species, reckless land grabs, depletion of oceans** \- all of these are caused by destructive agricultural and fishing practices that are incompatible with any UK/EU aspirations to bring our existence on this planet to a sustainable level (*as a reminder, planetary overshoot day happened two days ago*).

We are a new decentralised volunteer organisation, **ANIMAL REBELLION**, based on the principles of Non-Violent Direct Action and we are planning to lead over 10k of volunteers and activists to a major action in London, UK (*in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion*) to challenge animal agriculture and fishing industry in the UK and after that other countries - in the EU we will demand radical changes to CAP and CFP as they are not fit for purpose at the time of Ecological Collapse.

This is a one of a kind opportunity for environmentalists and animal rights activists to work together (overcoming any differences) to strongly challenge the European governments to redefine the current food production system.

**WHAT?** We will go out on the streets and exercise our human right to a peaceful protest and civil disobedience (*think Suffragettes, civil rights, Gandhi*) to demand the system change (*e.g. end animal agriculture/fishing industry subsidies, slash agricultural impact on climate change, stop oceans depletion*).

**HOW?** By joining forces with about 20 animal rights organisations and also influencers and celebrities and in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion - a successful environmental movement that attracted a lot of attention to the issue of climate crisis and obliteration of biodiversity. It is acknowledged that fighting climate change and reverting biodiversity loss is impossible without changing agricultural system on the land and fishing practices on the sea.

**WHERE?** Initially in London, UK, but other EU countries have also expressed interest in aligning their actions!

**WHY?** Because these are the most destructive activities on earth you can think of.

**WHEN?** 07 October will be the start of our two weeks of protest.

If you want to see lands and seas returned to nature and rewilded, **Volunteer with us** \- [https://actionnetwork.org/forms/animal-rebellion-volunteer-application-form/](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/animal-rebellion-volunteer-application-form/)

Our freshly baked **subreddit** [r/AnimalRebellion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalRebellion/)

**More information** on our site [http://www.animalrebellion.org/](http://www.animalrebellion.org/)

If you would like to help, but **based in continental Europe**, then consider the following activities:

**1. Create your local Animal Rebellion group,** using the same self-organising processes we've learnt from XR and following the 10 Principles as outlined on our website: [http://www.animalrebellion.org/values/](http://www.animalrebellion.org/values/)

**2. Contact our group coordinator, Tim Speers on** [**info@animalrebellion.org**](mailto:info@animalrebellion.org) **for support, training and documentation.** Tim will work with you and add you to the private discussion group for all Animal Rebellion local/national group coordinators. Please put ""NEW GROUP"" into the subject of your email to Tim.

**3. Find your local XR group through social media and express solidarity and interest in working together.** At the UK national level, Animal Rebellion and Extinction Rebellion are in talks to develop plans on how we best work together around actions, media and achieving our common goals. We hope to see this replicated across the globe.

**4. Plan a local action for October 7th and/or for the two following weeks.**

**5. Spread the word!** Follow us across all the social media channels.

**6. Contact your local and national media and help reach out to others.** Please contact our media team on [media@animalrebellion.org](mailto:media@animalrebellion.org) if you need any support with this.

**7. And stay in touch!**

660,7c387v,europe,"A Europhile's open letter to Mr. Juncker: Against blind nationalism, be it Spanish, Catalan or European",9,,1510340899,,0,"Dear Mr. Juncker,


On November 9th, 2017, you held a speech for the occasion of the honorary degree that you received from the University of Salamanca. In that speech, you called nationalism a ""poison"" that threatens European co-operation. A few days before that, when asked about your opinion on the criticism of the actions of the Spanish authorities in response to the Catalan crisis, you said: ""I do not think the rule of law is being violated by the Spanish authorities. I believe that those who do not respect the Spanish constitutional order are the ones violating the law"". 



I am a Fleming, but before that I consider myself Belgian and yes, European. I am no Flemish nationalist, and I disagree on many things with the N-VA, one of the ruling parties of my nation, as well as with the actions of Mr. Puigdemont and other ex-government members. I believe firmly in the necessity of a pan-European project, in order to tackle problems that are not solvable on a national or regional scale, like the towering threat of climate change. Like Mr. Macron, I believe that far-reaching European cooperation is an important factor in the 70 years of peace and stability that this historically bloody continent has known. 



I also believe that the European project should not limit itself to a common climate policy or a trade union. I believe that the E.U., this precious and fragile project, should aspire to hold itself and its member nations to a certain standard when it comes to certain values, most notably the respect for human rights. When Polish and Hungarian authorities enact illiberal measures, you are one of the many European leaders who vocally criticize and oppose them. Yet, I believe, as many of my fellow countrymen do, that you and many others might be employing a double standard as far as the actions of the Spanish authorities go. 



A few weeks ago, we could hear both in the regional Flemish parliament and the federal Belgian parliament widespread condemnation for the excessive police violence against referendum voters, across party lines. Our prime minister Charles Michel was indeed the only European leader who dared to put a critical asterisk next to the violence used by Spanish police during the illegal referendum, calling for dialogue and de-escalation, instead of keeping silent or uncritically and unconditionally backing the actions of Spanish authorities.



While the referendum for Catalan independence is illegal and the actions of Mr. Puigdemont and his colleagues were rash and in violation of the Spanish constitution and even Catalan rules, any punishment or accusation needs to be proportional. Many Belgian politicians, even those opposed to Flemish nationalism, feel that the charges of sedition and rebellion against Mr. Puigdemont, his colleagues and other activists for Catalan independence are trumped-up and exaggerated, as is the hypothetical maximal sentence of 30 years of imprisonment. Amnesty International condemns the pre-trial detention and charges of sedition of Mr. Cuixart and Mr. Sanchez, two pro-Catalan activists. 



Let it be clear that a criticism of these charges does not necessarily mean calling into question the separation of powers in Spain. Mr. Rajoy or his government are not responsible for the actions of the Spanish judiciary. Rather, a reflection has to be made that perhaps, the judges responsible for some of these actions might be of a Spanish-nationalist signature, and might have responded (disproportionally?) harshly to what they perceive as an attack on the unity and indivisibility of the Spanish state. 


One need not be anti-Spanish, pro-Catalan or anti-European to scrutinize the actions of a valued ally; on the contrary, I believe it would be against the interest of Spain and Europe to not hold the Spanish authorities to the same standards as everyone else. 


Therefore, I believe it is vital that you and other leaders of the E.U. show the public that the European Union is an impartial actor in this situation, one that is not a priori opposed to calling out unjust actions of their member nations should they ever occur, even when those are directed against a force that threatens the stability of the E.U. 


Already, detractors of the E.U. who'd rather see it destroyed are using the inflexible attitude of you and other E.U. leaders in this crisis as a tool in their populist arsenal. What I (and many others) ask of you is not much: simply, a call for de-escalation and dialogue, like that made by our prime minister Mr. Michel, would be a step in the right direction. 


When you call nationalism a threat to European co-operation, I partly disagree. After all, if we are perfectly honest, those who dream of a united Europe are, in a sense, nationalists themselves: European nationalists. As someone who dreams of a more united Europe, I associate the E.U. flag and the tones of ""Ode to Joy"" with pleasant feelings; I suspect this might even be the case for yourself. In that sense, I find a complete dismissal of nationalism incoherent. 


Nevertheless, what I condemn is blind nationalism. A situation like the one in Catalonia is more likely when there is blind nationalism on both sides: those Catalans who want independence despite the economical cost and loss of stability, and those Spaniards who are so inflexible that even a demand for more autonomy is perceived as a great insult. I suspect this stubbornness on both sides has allowed the situation to fester like it has. 


So, as I'm opposed to blind Spanish/Belgian or Catalan/Flemish nationalism, so too to blind European nationalism that cracks down harshly on any perceived potential threat to its unity. Endless dialogue and compromise have made that despite its many faults, my little country of Belgium still survives to this day. At the risk of sounding chauvinistic. I hope that in this aspect, the future E.U. takes more of a leaf out of the Belgian book. ",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7c387v/a_europhiles_open_letter_to_mr_juncker_against/,1

I'm talking long term (5 or so years), to use as a base for travel, making money and living as a young person. 

My analysis so far (not very qualified - only have worked/travelled in France for about 9 months and Switerland for 1). https://imgur.com/xaNxLQu
Any additions, thoughts, experiences and judgements in the comments much appreciated: 

**Interesting to see the ratio between median income and average costs to work out about the same between the countries. I am pretty frugal and my main goal is saving money at the moment, to pay off my student loan. 

Also, how hard has it been for British expats to naturalise and take the required permits in Switzerland?

This is important to me as a British citizen pre brexit and from what I can tell, ""UK nationals who in accordance with Union law legally reside in an EU27 Member State by the specified date (ie Brexit) fall within the scope of the Withdrawal Agreement"" and will therefore maintain their rights post brexit. Therefore I want to have the residency in the best possible country possible for the next few years. I much prefer European life to British as the UK might as well be New Zealand culturally and linguistically.

Situation: 
Combined New Zealand/British Citizen, 23, living on the Frontiere and working in Geneva on a C permit (frontaliere)
Bachelor of Science in Earth Science/Geology, 10 months professional geologist experience. Goal to work in NGO/Public Private Partner Ship in environmental/climate change context. Would like to do a Masters one day though not before having more professional experience
Working conversational level of French for administration affairs, business related telephone calls and general conversation. Highly motivated to be fluent.

Any experienced expats, people in similar situations or local people who know the life well, please advise...

703,8su0i1,europe,Letter I wrote to my MEP re Articles 11 &amp; 13,3,,1529603732,,0,"Dear Marian,


Your approach is a fair one and generally has my support. There are however a couple of things I would like to point out. 


Sharing breed innovation. My whole career, and many like mine, is built off the back of the open source software movement. If platforms, such as the code hosting platform Github or the code sharing platform Stackoverflow, are suddenly subject to content filtering controls on upload the software creation process will break irrevocably. This will not only be a disaster for software development but also the economy and innovation. 


The world is faced with almost insurmountable challenges ahead in developing the policies and also the technologies to combat climate change and pollution for example. These challenges will not be overcome by artificially restricting the flow of information. We need to share more not less. This goes for software, scientific papers, social media etc Open sharing is the way of the future. Criminalising sharing will only push it underground again, in turn criminalising whole industries in turn from software engineering to scientific research. The law will not change the natural behaviours of a continent. Yes people deserve compensation for their creations but this is not a perpetual irrevocable right that should be allowed be abused at the cost of the benefit of society.


""we need to listen and look very carefully and not be swayed by the big platforms and their power to buy sites to spam us either by social media or internet.""


I'm glad you brought this up. It is clear Articles 11 &amp; 13 are being lobbied for by the large entrenched media dinosaurs of the 20th century, with outdated business models, who fear losing everything due to their inability to adapt. It is unfortunate that Europe has not been able to produce a Google or a Facebook and these laws seem to be an attempt at a shot across their bows. Instead I would suggest that the EU focus their efforts on creating a progressive environment which will foster technological advancement and equip European citizens and businesses with the tools and resources to look forward and face the challenges of the 21st century rather than to be looking back, burdened with the failures of the 20th. Who knows, perhaps we can create a Google or Facebook based on the European values of fairness, balance and progress.

More specifically, it's been usual for Athens, the city where I live, to have at least 2 weeks every summer, usually during July, where the temperature during the day goes from 40c to around 43. This year though, the temp hasn't reached 40c not even once! :O That's so extraordinary. 

The highest temp this summer was 35c. Aside from this, I also want to share another thing that I've noticed regarding climate change. The past 3 years there is a trend of the climate becoming more wet. Usually rain would stop at around the end of May, and it would start again in October.

#The President of the European Commission

**Jean-Claude Juncker**

Term: 1 November 2014 - 31 October 2019

Jean-Claude Juncker started as a deputy in Luxembourg in 1984. Soon after, he started taking on various governmental roles. He because Luxembourg’s minister of finances in 1989, and subsequently became Prime Minister of Luxembourg, holding the office between 1995 and 2013.

Juncker held the Eurogroup presidency from 2005 to 2013, serving 3 terms. He was then chosen as the European People’s Party lead candidate for the 2014 European Parliament elections.  He was proposed by the European Council afterwards, and the European Parliament voted in favour of him being President. He has previously announced he will not stand for a second term as President, meaning his tenure will end on the 31st October 2019.

#Current European political topics

###European Parliament Elections

Between May 23rd to the 26th 2019, elections to the European Parliament will be held. Following Brexit, the amount of MEPs will be reduced to 705, with some of the UK’s MEPs being redistributed to other member states and some being held in reserve for any potential enlargements of the EU.

The European Parliament has confirmed that it will follow the “Spitzenkandidaten” process once more. The European political parties will endorse ‘lead candidates’ ahead of the vote which will compete to be President of the European Commission. The European Council officially proposes a candidate for Commission President, ‘taking into account’ the results of the Parliament elections. However, the European Parliament has already stated it will reject any candidate who was not designated as a ‘lead candidate’ ahead of time.

**Candidates**:

Candidate | Date Announced | European Political Party
-|-|-
Maroš Šefčovič | [4th June 2018](https://www.politico.eu/article/maros-sefcovic-enters-race-to-become-european-commission-president/)| Party of European Socialists
Ska Keller | [9th July 2018](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute/eu-spitzenkandidatin-fuer-2019-gruene-nominieren-ska-keller-100.html) | European Greens
Manfred Weber | [5th September 2018](https://www.politico.eu/article/manfred-webers-commission-president-pitch/) | European People's Party

The European Commission is set to [propose](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-to-crack-down-on-data-misuse-ahead-of-european-elections/) rules that could result in the political parties at the EU level (European People’s Party, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe etc.) being fined up to 5% of their annual budget if they misuse personal data in a similar way to how Cambridge Analytica operated, trying to influence elections with this data. 

As part of a broader package to counter online voter manipulation and personal data misuse for political purposes, the European Commission will recommend that governments should crack down on “micro-targeting”, the practice of sending personalised political messages to users without their consent. It will also be recommended that member states introduce stricter transparency requirements on online political advertising.

Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality Vera Jourova has [said](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/brussels-targets-parties-misuse-of-personal-voter-data-1.3608273) that voters should be able to “always understand when something is an online campaign, who runs the campaign, who pays for it and what they want to achieve.” However, she said that the EU wouldn’t go as far as regulating the online activity of any political grouping, stating that the internet is a “zone for free expression.”

[Overview of the European Parliament elections, 2019](https://www.reddit.com//r/europeanunion/wiki/elections)

###Eurozone

In the [2017 SOTEU speech](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3165_en.htm), Juncker proposed an EU minister of finance, who would be a Vice-President of the Commission and also President of the Eurogroup, the informal meeting of Eurozone finance ministers. By extension, they would also be Chair of the board of the European Monetary Fund. This minister could oversee the use of EU budgetary instruments and represent the euro area at a global level. 

In December 2017, the Commission proposed to integrate the European Stability Mechanism (to become the European Monetary Fund) and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance into EU law. The possibility of introducing an EU finance minister who would be a Vice President of the Commission as well as chair of the Eurogroup was also floated. They could oversee the budgetary instruments of the EU and represent the Euro area at a global level.

The [Meseberg Declaration](https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/EN/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2018/2018-06-19-meseberg-declaration.html) agreed between France and Germany calls for establishing a eurozone budget for competitiveness, convergence and stablisation within the framework of the EU. Resources would come from national contributions, allocation of tax revenue and European resources. However, 12 EU member states including Austria, Finland and the Netherlands questioned the need for any “fiscal capacity”, saying that there is “wide divergence” on the need for any budget, or at least what form it may take.

More recently, Germany’s deputy finance minister Jörg Kukies has [stated](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-eu-has-more-pressing-issues-than-eurozone-budget/) that talks on a Eurozone budget should not distract from talks on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the EU’s multi-annual budget.  The “most pressing issue” was to figure out how the EU budget can contribute to stabilization, competitiveness and convergence. “This is a more relevant question than carving out a separate budget for the Eurozone”.

Under the Commission’s [MFF Proposals](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/economic-and-monetary-union-programmes_en), the European Commission proposed a €30 billion European Investment Stabilisation Function, which would provide back-to-back loans to a member state experiencing financial difficulties, provided they adhered to relevant EU budgetary rules beforehand. 

A Convergence Facility for Member States actively trying to join the euro will be introduced, assisting member states with the reforms needed to do so. Bulgaria is actively attempting to join the euro, and will have to join the system of EU banking supervision (banking union) as well as the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) for 2 years before it can join the euro area.

A Reform Support Programme of €25 billion has also been proposed, which would provide financial incentives and also provide technical assistance for EU member states to carry out structural reforms. This programme is voluntary, and the money could be claimed back if the reforms are reversed.

In June 2018, EU leaders [agreed](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/35999/29-euro-summit-statement-en.pdf) in principle on making the European Stability Mechanism the backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. The Fund is used to wind down/resolve banks that have been declared failing or likely to fail by the European Central Bank, and shall reach the target level of at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions within the Banking Union by 2024. The backstop should effectively double its capacity, providing around €55 billion of support.

Eurozone countries will work towards an agreement in December 2018 to change how the ESM functions, including creating the backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and how the ESM is governed. In future it could be integrated into EU law following the Commission’s proposal.

Eurozone finance ministers also agreed to work towards adopting a roadmap on starting political discussions on a European Deposit Insurance Scheme in December 2018. This Scheme would guarantee deposits of up to €100,000. When a bank is placed into insolvency or in resolution and it is necessary to pay out deposits, the national schemes and the European Deposit Insurance Scheme could intervene. 

[Factsheets on Deepening Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/completing-europes-economic-and-monetary-union-factsheets_en)

###Migration

In June 2018, the European Council [adopted conclusions](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/06/29/20180628-euco-conclusions-final/) on migration, calling on, among other things, for vessels operating in the Mediterranean to respect international law and not impede the work of the Libyan Coast Guard. Disembarkation platforms in third countries from which some asylum seekers could be relocated and voluntary controlled centres in EU member states were an option agreed to, though no country has currently agreed to host either. There was also agreement on the need to have dedicated funds to manage external migration in the next MFF.

The aim of ‘controlled centres’ inside the EU would be to improve the process of distinguishing between those individuals who qualify for refugee status, and those who don’t. The centres would be managed by a Member State with support from EU agencies. The Commission has offered to assist any member state granting access to their ports for disembarkation through a disembarkation team, which could include around 500 people from Frontex, Europol and the European Asylum Support Office. The EU budget could also cover all infrastructure and operational costs. The initial registration and asylum screening process could be as short as 72 hours.

For those Member States which agree to process a share of those disembarked from sea, the Commision is offering to allocate €6,000 per person relocated and will cover the transfer costs of €500 per person given to the country of disembarkation. 

The European Commission intends to [propose an upgrade](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/11908/european-union-plans-to-expand-frontex) to the European Border and Coastguard Agency (Frontex) to have 10,000 officiers by 2020, though most of them could be from a pool of national border guards to start with, with 50% of staff being permanent by 2027. It will have the power to bear arms, and would aim to intercept new arrivals, stop unauthorised travel between EU states and accelerate the return of rejected asylum seekers to their countries of origin, even without the consent of the member state. The agency would also gain more powers to exchange information with third countries. A senior EU official has been [quoted](https://www.ft.com/content/d5806e9e-b421-11e8-bbc3-ccd7de085ffe) as saying “we want to federalise external border protection as much as possible and help out countries on the front line.” However, certain EU member states such as Malta are reluctant about further competence shifts to Frontex.

The Italian government has recently been rejecting NGO vessels rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean from docking in Italy, though other member states such as Malta and France have done this as well. Italy has also rejected permission for Italian navy ships to dock in Italy to disembark rescued migrants, and threatened to torpedo Operation Sophia (the EU’s naval mission in the Mediterranean to combat people smuggling) if the rules weren’t changed to stop the automatic disembarkation of rescued migrants in Italy. The possibility of simply rejecting Sophia vessels from docking in Italian ports was also floated.

On 24th August, the Italian government threatened to withhold its EU budget contribution if other EU countries didn’t agree to taking migrants from the Italian Coast Guard ship Diciotti, currently stranded in an Italian port. The European Commission called a meeting of 12 EU member states, but no agreement was found at that meeting.

Only Ireland and Albania agreed to take in some of the migrants, and Italy also threatened to veto the EU’s next multi-year budget, the Multiannual Financial Framework if the EU didn’t start to share in the intake of migrants. The MFF is adopted by unanimous approval among member states following the approval of the European Parliament.

Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources Günther Oettinger [pointed out](https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/oettinger-warns-italy-not-to-block-eu-budget-talks/) that Italy refusing to pay its budgetary contribution would be the first time that event happened in the history of the European Union, and Italy would potentially face both late interest payments and sanctions.

The reform of the Common European Asylum System, comprising 7 proposals, may be touched upon:

 Proposal | Description | Stage of legislative process
 -|--|-
 Dublin Regulation | Determines which member state is responsible for processing an application for international protection | EP adopted position, Council yet to adopt a position
 Eurodac Regulation| Strengthen the Eurodac fingerprint database by collecting more data such as facial images to facilitate returns and help tackle irregular migration | [Political agreement] 
 EU Asylum Agency | Upgrading the European Asylum Support Office to a full EU Asylum Agency, providing guidance and assistance for assessments of asylum applications  |  Agreement, but won’t be adopted until other proposals finalised 
 Asylum Procedure Regulation |  Aims to achieve a fully harmonised EU procedure for granting and withdrawing international protection| EP adopted position, Council yet to adopt a position
 Qualification Regulation | Harmonised protection standards and rights for asylum seekers, ensuring asylum seekers are treated in the same way in all member states | Negotiations between EP and Council
 Reception Conditions [Directive] | Harmonised EU reception standards for asylum seekers | Negotiations between EP and Council
EU Resettlement Framework | Common framework for EU member states resettling recognised refugees from outside EU territory | Negotiations between EP and Council

There will be a report on progress during the October 2018 European Council.

The latest proposals from the Austrian presidency are to have a form of “mandatory” solidarity whereby member states are free to help with migration either by taking in migrants, giving experts and equipment or contributing in some other way. However, Italy reportedly rejects this plan and wants more relocation of migrants.

###Trade

In July 2018, President Trump and President Juncker came to an agreement on trade which provided for negotiations which would explore the possibility of negotiating a deal facilitating zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. Tariffs on automobiles are stopped for as long as there is suitable progress on negotiations, with the tariffs on steel and aluminium being reviewed. 

Trump later dismissed the EU’s offer on tariffs as “not good enough” and said the EU’s trade policies were almost as bad as China’s after Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström said the EU was “willing to bring down...our car tariffs to zero”, provided the USA did the same. The USA is holding out on the prospect of a partial trade deal within the next two months.

If tariffs on cars were to be introduced, the European Commission has been working on a list of US products that would face retaliatory tariffs.

Italy has threatened to veto the ratification of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) negotiated with Canada. Currently, the trade deal is provisionally applied, meaning most of its provisions are in force pending the ratification of all member states. If a member state fails to ratify, provisional application has to be terminated. 

In last year’s SOTEU speech, Juncker announced that all proposed negotiating mandates for future trade and investment details would be published, starting for the negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.

The status of the EU’s trade deal negotiations is as follows: 

Country | Status
-|-
Australia | Negotiation, 2nd round in November
Canada | Provisionally applied since 21st September 2017, but CJEU case pending on the compatibility of its court system with EU law. Austria’s and Belgium’s ratification depend on the outcome of this case.
Chile | Negotiation, 3rd round concluded in June 2018, no new date set.
Indonesia | Negotiation, 6th round in October 2018
Japan | Signed, but yet to be ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Aim to be applied by April 2019, before Brexit. No national ratification is needed.
Singapore | Commission has proposed decision to sign and ratify the EU-Singapore agreements. The FTA will only need European Parliament and Council of Ministers approval, while the Investment Protection Agreement will need that in addition to national ratification.
Mercosur | Negotiation, next round September 10th - 14th, will require national ratification.
New Zealand | Negotiation, 1st round concluded in July 2018
Mexico | Agreement in principle, aim to finish the legal text by the end of 2018.
Vietnam | Currently undergoing translation into all EU languages, Commission will then propose to sign and ratify the deal. Also split into a Free Trade Agreement (EP/Council approval) and an Investment Protection Agreement (requiring national ratification). 


###Rule of Law

In December 2017, the European Commission [activated](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-5367_en.htm) Article 7(1) for the first time in the history of the EU, citing threats to the rule of law and judicial independence in Poland. Infringement proceedings have also been launched against the Law on Ordinary Courts, and most recently against the Law on the Supreme Court, which may have forced around 40% of Supreme Court judges to retire. The Supreme Court has suspended the law as it awaits the results of a CJEU case on the law.

The European Parliament will vote on whether or not to Article 7(1) against Hungary later today, determining a clear risk of a serious breach of the EU’s values, after the Civil Liberties committee adopted a report recommending its activation. The European Parliament will have to vote by a ⅔ majority to trigger the article, though abstentions will not count towards this threshold. The European People’s Party, of which the governing party of Hungary Fidesz is a member, will be given a free vote on the matter.

Following this, a hearing will be conducted of Hungary where the Council can address recommendations to it. The Council needs to vote by a ⅘ majority to actually determine a clear risk of a serious breach of the EU’s values. This is separate from Article 7(2), which is the process leading to sanctions. 

As part of the 2021-2027 MFF proposals, the Commission has [proposed](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/protection-union-budget-rule-law-may2018_en.pdf) a mechanism whereby EU funding could be suspended to member states that don’t have independent judiciaries or flout the rule of law. The Commission would propose to suspend funding, and the decision is presumed to be adopted unless a qualified majority of EU countries votes against it. Individual beneficiaries of EU funding through schemes such as Erasmus+ should not be affected. 

In October 2018, the Commission intends to produce a mechanism to promote the rule of law in the European Union, though it is not yet clear what form this may take.

The Commission will also produce a document which discusses the possibility of expanding the competences of the **European Public Prosecutor’s Office** to fight cross-border terrorism, which currently has a mandate to fight fraud against the EU budget. 22 member states (all bar Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Sweden &amp; the United Kingdom) are currently part of the project.

###Brexit

The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached agreement on at least 80% of the draft withdrawal agreement text, including issues such as the rights of EU citizens post Brexit and the budgetary settlement that the UK will pay. Agreement was also reached on a transition period, where the UK would follow EU law and pay into the budget as if it was a member until December 31st, 2020. The UK can negotiate and sign deals during this period but not implement them unless authorised by the European Commission.

Negotiations are still needed on certain issues, such as the Protocol on Northern Ireland and the way a hard border can be avoided between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus, Gibraltar, data protection, ongoing police and judicial cooperation, the role of the EU Court of Justice and geographical indicators are other areas that are yet to be resolved.

The UK Government published a White Paper (also referred to as the ‘Chequers’ agreement) on July 12th, 2018, leading to the resignation of Cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis from the government. The EU has also opposed this agreement, with Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier stating that accepting it could be “the end of the single market and the European project.” It is still controversial in the UK as well, with a former Brexit minister Steve Baker predicting up to 80 Conservative MPs could vote against the agreement. The UK government may even scrap the agreement if the EU gives way on its hard position on the Irish border.

Some EU member states are considering giving Barnier a new mandate to help close a Brexit deal, which will be discussed at the Salzburg summit in a week's time. The planned timing of a deal and the remaining sticking points such as the Irish border will be discussed. Formal guidelines would be adopted by the October European Council, and talks would aimed to be concluded at a hypothetical special Brexit summit in November. However, other sources have said that the current guidelines are sufficient and that the UK may not like the content of hypothetical new guidelines.

The Brexit withdrawal agreement will need the consent of the European Parliament and a reinforced qualified majority vote (72% of the states representing 65% of the population) in the Council of Ministers. It will be accompanied by a political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU, though negotiations can’t properly start until the UK becomes a third country.

###Internal Market

Following a [public consultation](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-5302_en.htm) in which 4.6 million European citizens replied, the European Commission will propose to scrap the biannual change in the clocks. 84% of those who responded were in favour of scrapping the change. Commissioner for Transport Violeta Bulc has stated the change was unlikely to happen before 2021 at the earliest. EU countries are free to decide on their own time zones.

A “digital tax” was proposed by the European Commission whereby EU member states would charge a 3% levy on large companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google. This idea has proved controversial, with countries such as Ireland preferring a solution adopted at a global level to avoid stifling investment and innovation. 

To facilitate agreement on the file, France has said it could consider ways to compensate Ireland for possible lost revenues from the proposal, and a [""sunset clause""](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tax-digital/germany-cautious-on-eu-tech-tax-as-france-adds-sunset-clause-idUKKCN1LO0A4) has been suggested where by the EU tax would no longer have effect once the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) comes up with a global solution. The aim is to agree on the EU tax by the end of 2018.

###Foreign Relations

High Representative Federica Mogherini wants to see a binding agreement on relations between Serbia and Kosovo by the end of her mandate in November 2019. Recently, there have been suggestions of [‘border swaps’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/us-backed-kosovo-land-swap-border-plan-under-fire-from-all-sides) between Kosovo and Serbia to agree on a deal. Some have been receptive to the idea, but countries such as Germany have rejected any border changes.

Germany has begun construction of Nord Stream II in German coastal waters, a controversial gas pipeline with Russia, despite the threat of US sanctions on the companies involved in financing the pipeline and the objection of some Eastern European states. President Trump has started that the project would make Germany a “captive” of Russia.

Germany, Finland, Sweden and Russia have given approval for the pipeline to pass through their territorial waters, but Denmark’s approval is still pending. Nord Stream 2 [filed an application](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-gazprom-nordstream/russia-led-nord-stream-2-seeks-new-route-to-avoid-danish-waters-idUKKBN1KV118) to Denmark for a new route that would avoid Denmark’s territorial waters altogether. 

The European Commission also published a plan to [provide €18 million in aid](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/defying-us-sanctions-eu-unveils-a-e18-million-aid-package-to-iran/) to Iran following some US sanctions being re-introduced on August 6th. In November, the US will introduce sanctions on oil. The EU has introduced a ‘blocking statute’ which forbids companies from complying with US sanctions. If firms are wanting to pull out of Iran to comply with US sanctions, they should get EU authorisation, but not if it is a business decision. 

A communication on extending the use of qualified majority voting (QMV) in foreign policy will be produced, exploring the possibility of introducing QMV rules on human rights, sanctions, and joint civilian mission decisions. Certain sanctions regimes may keep unanimity rules, but it could be used especially when the EU has to implement UN sanctions. It will require unanimous agreement among all member states to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting rules. 

###Environment

On Monday, the European Parliament’s Environment committee [voted for cutting emissions](https://www.euractiv.com/section/transport/news/meps-put-pedal-to-metal-and-boost-car-co2-limits/) for cars and vans by 20% by 2025 and 45% by 2030, above the targets of 15% and 30% proposed by the Commission. The plenary of the European Parliament will vote on the issue next month. 

Carbon prices under the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) hit a [decade high](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-23/carbon-reaching-20-euros-a-ton-in-europe-raises-price-for-power) in August 2018 at €20 a tonne, following reforms to introduce a Market Stability Reserve that removes excess credits from the market.

The ETS provides ‘licences’ to pollute a certain amount each year. Those businesses that don’t have enough licences for the amount of pollution they give off are required to purchase more else they are fined, while those who have more licences than needed can sell the excess. The cap is progressively reduced over time so as to reduce carbon emissions within the EU.

The European Commission will potentially produce a long-term EU strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in November 2018.

#Previous State of the European Union Speeches

###[2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6zpaz3/state_of_the_european_union/)

President Juncker presented a much more upbeat picture of the state of the EU, saying ""the wind is back in Europe's sails."" He rejected calls for a multi-speed Europe, stating that “Europe must breathe with both lungs. Otherwise our continent will struggle for air.” He also stated that now was the time for completing the “European House” as the “sun is shining”.

He announced various proposals, such as creating an EU Cybersecurity Agency, trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand, reforms of the Eurozone, opening up Schengen to Bulgaria and Romania, and moving to more qualified majority voting for certain decisions. 

###2016

For Juncker’s second SOTEU speech, he again put forward a somewhat gloomy picture of the state of the EU, stating that “our European Union is, at least in part, in an existential crisis”. This speech followed the UK’s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016.

He mentioned how the EU was currently facing many “unresolved problems”, and revealed proposals the Commission would be putting forward over the next year to try to resolve them, attempting to create a Europe that “protects, empowers and defends”. 

###2015

Juncker’s first SOTEU speech as Commission President mentioned how there was “not enough Union in this Union”, painting a somewhat dark picture of the state of the European Union at the time.

The main topics of his speech were migration, the Eurozone crisis, the UK’s (then) future referendum on EU membership, EU-Ukraine relations and addressing climate change.

###2014

There was no State of the Union speech, as it was the year of the European Parliament elections.

305,9cuhol,europe,I want to leave Germany,73,,1536057942,,0,"Hello everyone,

I'm thinking about leaving Germany.
The center of our society seems to fade and the left and right wing become bigger and bigger.

Our government doesn't really understand the problem and the media is getting more and more biased and subjective.



We don't have a problem with racism here, we have a problem with intolerance about people who think different than the majority.
People are getting called Nazis only because they speak their mind.
They can't defend themselves and argue because nobody listens to them.

Our federal president promotes a band on Facebook that openly calls for violence against the police by destroying their heads with billets.


I have the big fear that the situation right now might end in a civil war because the government seems to do absolutely nothing about the increasing violence and aggressive political mood.


I don't feel home in Germany anymore for several years because our society became a gathering of pseudo-political activists from both, left and right wing. 

What steps can I do to get away from this country as soon as possible? What are some countries that offer a similar living standard, climate but keep more to themselves?


I'm very sceptical about the EU and would like to move to a more nationalist country that doesn't engage in world affairs.


What can I do?",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9cuhol/i_want_to_leave_germany/,0

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are targets for global development adopted in September 2015, set to be achieved by 2030. All countries of the world have agreed to work towards achieving these goals.

Our SDG Tracker presents data across all available indicators from the Our World in Data database, using official statistics from the UN and other international organizations. It is the first publication that tracks global progress towards the SDGs and allows people around the world to hold their governments accountable to achieving the agreed goals.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals are defined in a list of 169 SDG Targets. Progress towards these Targets is agreed to be tracked by 232 unique Indicators. Here is the full list of definitions.

This new version of our SDG-Tracker was launched on 28th June 2018. We will keep this up-to-date with the most recent data and SDG developments through to the end of the 2030 Agenda.

For many Indicators data is available, but major data gaps remain. If you are aware of high-quality data we have yet to include please notify us. We hope that this collaborative approach allows us to support the United Nations in developing the most complete and up-to-date sources for tracking global progress to 2030.

643,a5x2cl,europe,A simplified story of Bosnia and Herzegovina,4,,1544731383,,0,"Hi all -

I'm  working on short documentary about B+H and I want to see what you guys  think of the script. The video has to be under 4 minutes, so this is  simplified on purpose. I also know this is a controversial topic, so it  will be interesting to see the different perspectives.

Part 1:

Bosnia  and Hertzogovenia is one of the most beautiful countries I’ve ever  visited. The mountains take my breath away. It also has a really unique  blend of cultures.

You can shop for  gorgeous ornamental crafts in Sarajevo and go swimming in amazing  natural waterfalls and hike through old castles outside of Mostar.

Welcome to Worldview with Captain Kurt!

Bosnia is one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world, but it had to overcome a massive challenge to get here.

The  beauty of Bosnia can make it hard to image the civil war that raged  from 1992 to 1995. Since the Bosnian War ended, the country has become a  success story of the world, due in a large part to tourism.

The  story goes way back to 2000 years ago, when the area is part of the  Roman Empire, which split into two parts, the Eastern Roman Empire and  Western Roman Empire. Bosnia is near the border of the split. Learn  about that in this Rome episode.

The  Roman Catholic church grows out of the Western Roman Empire and the  Eastern Orthodox Church grows out of the Eastern Roman Empire. Bosnia  straddles the two different cultures.

Nearby  the Ottoman Empire grows and takes over what is now Bosnia in the 14th  century. The Ottoman Empire, which is predominantly Muslim, defeats the  the Roman Empire - learn about that in the Istanbul episode. Just over  half of Bosnia’s population is still Muslim.

Today’s capital Sarajevo is founded by the Ottomans, as well as the city of Mostar.

The  country bridges these different religions and cultures. Hundreds of  years later those differences factor into one of the country’s most  difficult struggles.

For most of  Bosnia's history, everyone gets along pretty well. In the 1400s the  Ottomans build a massive stone bridge in Mostar, that comes to represent  this “bridge” of cultures. People begin to visit from around the world.  It's now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. UNESCO calls the area ""an  outstanding example of a multicultural urban settlement” because of the  Western European, Mediterranean and Ottoman influences.

Now in the 1800s, tension grows between the different religious groups - causing revolts.

The Austro-Hungarian empire gradually takes over Bosnia. They rule until they lose World War One.

After that, the area that is now Bosnia becomes part of the former Yugoslavia.

But  in the 1990s Yugoslavia begins to splinter. In 1992 Bosnia votes to  break off from Yugoslavia, dealing a fatal blow. But not everyone in  Bosnia agrees with the breakup, and this sparks a terrible civil war.

In Part 2 we’ll learn about the Bosnian war and the transformation that happened to the country when the war ends in 1995.

Bosnia  is beautiful to visit now, but you can still see some of the scars that  remind you of the brutal war that ended decades ago.

Now  Bosnia is one of the most frequently visited countries in the area, a  testament to the resilience of its people. Any threats from the war are  long gone. In fact, tourism is one of the most important factors in the  revitalization of Bosnia, helping pull its economy up. It’s a great  example of how sustainable tourism can transform an area and economy and  lift populations out of difficult situations.

In  fact travelers all over the world are starting to use their vacations  as a way to give back to the world with their tourism dollars. It’s a  fun way to contribute because all you have to do is go on vacation.

Part 2:

Bosnia  is a land of Beauty. In part one we learned about the variety of  cultures that have influenced that area. For much of its history, these  cultures existed relatively peacefully. Now it’s one of the fastest  growing tourist hotspots. But it wasn’t always that way.

The  Roman Empire conquered the area and split in two - the Orthodox Serbs  and Roman Catholic Croats were born from those two sides. Then the  Ottoman Empire took over and the [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam)[ Bosniaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosniaks) were born from that.

Land ownership disputes popped up.

In April 1992, the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia.

On April 7, Bosnian Serb forces begin firing on[ Sarajevo](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sarajevo). A brutal civil war erupts with the three sides fighting each other.

Snipers targeted civilians.

During the war the Mostar Bridge, a representation of unity, is shelled and knocked down into the river below.

The  warring parties finally agree to peace in 1995. The violence stops. In  1996 Bosnian Muslims, Serbs, and Croats elected three presidents—one for  each of the ethnic groups. The country comes back together and begins  to heal.

Right after the war, tourists  were cautious. Was it really safe again? But the peace held. Month by  month, more and more tourists arrive. By the end of the year,  miraculously Bosnia has the third highest growth rate for tourism in the  world! And that growth rates continues, even today.

Ten  years later UNESCO helps rebuild the Mostar Bridge. Once again the  bridge symbolizes resilience and the ability for different groups to  mend their differences and get along.

UNESCO   says ""The reconstructed Old Bridge and Old City of Mostar is a symbol  of reconciliation, international co-operation and of the coexistence of  diverse cultural, ethnic and religious communities.”

**Tourism**

Bosnia  and Herzegovina is special for its undisturbed natural areas in this  regiona and has lots of wild and untouched nature attracting adventurers  and nature lovers.

Put my tourism pitch here (maybe me in the airport)

This is often called sustainable travel.

It’s  becoming a hotspot, and that is great news. People love the beauty and  that it is more affordable and less crowded than some of the more  popular tourist spots. It also has such a rich history that is hard to  match.",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/a5x2cl/a_simplified_story_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina/,1

User u/deeznutzforone states that wars and hitmen have been initiated/sent over much less important things. I would like to know which wars specifically and how that turned out after it was over. I dare say not too good. So I don't understand the point of bringing it up.

u/deeznutzforone even states that wars WILL STILL BE fought over much less important things. I don't know how that can be foreseen, but can you imagine if in 2050 we start a war over a guinness world record? God I hope that forecast is wrong.

Now the case with ""heavy sanctions against Brazil"". Really? Because heavy sanctions are working so well in Venezuela, Syria, Lybia, Iran, North Korea?

What would the heavy sanctions accomplish in this scenario other than further deteriorate an already fragile and unstable democracy/country/population and push it over the edge to become another authoritarian regime in a devastated country?

Let’s also not be hypocritical and forget the multitude of european companies exploiting the amazon and polluting river beds and nascents (e.g: the norwegian mining company dumping toxic waste in amazon’s rivers). Perhaps you should urge your governments and companies to first stop treating Brazil and other countries as colonies for exploration.

Maybe (and probably) u/deeznutzforone had the right thought in mind and wished for the best result, but there’s more than meets the eye in these scenarios for the extraordinary complexity it holds. People often forget to measure in the side effects of ideas such as these ones, and the domino effect it can create. You just cannot reduce such a complex problem to a simple solution. I’d go as far as saying it’s irresponsible to spread ideas like these if you advocate for full truths (in an era of fake news and half truths).

Sanctions are usually issued from government(s) to government(s), but they usually endup being from government(s) to population(s). It’s always the weakest link that pays the price.

Sanctions are literally the last step before escalating to physical actions with long term consequences. In either way, coporations and governments win, environments and population lose. 

Diplomacy (and even manipulation) is by far the best qualified tool for the job. It‘s often overlooked as it’s much harder to come up with a diplomatic solution than a military/sanctions solutions. But it’s the only way we can evolve as society. 

There are many talks but not enough communication. The lack of literacy in the world, be it political, cultural, societal, logical, etc, is what leads to Trump and Bolsonaro getting elected, to the environment getting destroyed, and to conflicts being started. We need to advance in these fields as a society if we are to survive and see sustainable living actually working.

Spanning eight countries, the Alps are widely recognized as one of the world's most iconic, idyllic destinations. Less known is their important role as a source of clean power for Europe throughout the twentieth century. In this panel, Professor **Marc Landry** (University of New Orleans) joins Prof. **Patrick Kupper** (University of Innsbruck) and **Anna-Katharina von Krauland** (PhD Candidate, Stanford University) to discuss the Alps as a historical case study for renewable energy production, and the lessons these mountains hold for a sustainable future.

Hello r/europe it's EU&amp;U

Since the last time we posted we managed to get our EU podcast pilot episode up and running on Spotify and soon itunes. I am quite pleased with the content side of things but unfortunately something went wrong and one of our mics sounds a bit distorted, I hope that it will be ok for the time being but we will take extra precautions for the next episode.

I wanted to thank everyone for the feedback on the logo, I got in contact with the creator of the art and got his blessing to use it for our podcast, we also saw some comments pointing out some minor changes we could do to make it pop more so we adapted a border with the EU flag colors.

Since this is our pilot episode we are looking forward to any and all comments/feedback on our show and format but if you do not have time to explain I'll summarize it briefly:

Every couple of weeks my friend and I will have compiled a list of links and articles about events that happened around the EU and will read them on our own without discussing them with each other until we start recording the podcast. This way I think each person will make his own individual notes and the conversation wouldn't be tied to a script. I want it to feel like the conversations we usually have about the EU only that we actually prepare for them so we can back up our facts with worthy news outlets and hard data.

Some of the stories might be more serious, as you can see in this week episode, while others could be more in the line of fun facts or interesting tidbits about Member States, as was the case this week with the leaning tower of Pisa.

In addition to the ""News Recap"" we also want to discuss a specific topic in every episode, in the Pilot we went over the importance and functioning of the European Elections but we are looking forward to having episodes where we focus about topics such as European Foreign Policy, Sustainability, Migration, and other interesting topics.

If anyone has ideas to pitch we are all ears

After the first few episodes we are thinking of inviting guests to the show to join us in our specific topic discussion segment. I think this would really increase the value and quality of the show and possibly help to generate more traffic.

Do you have any guests you'd like to hear from? Or are you part of a European initiative and feel like coming on the show?

For now we don't really have a following to ask feedback to but this seems like the best community to get some interested and informed opinions from so I thank you very much for your support!

We are also looking forward to posting more mini articles about interesting things that are happening in the European Parliament and Member States, as we have done last week with the Telecommunications write up linked here:

808,ephetq,europe,Is Hungary a Healthy Country?,1,,1579169235,,0,"European Union is well-known for its efficient and dynamic healthcare facilities. The region has developed advanced technologies in the field of healthcare along with the skilled workforce of doctors. Hungary as a country is not behind in the race. Speaking of medical tourism, Europe dominates the entire scenario as a reason for its excellence and superiority in various health parameters. Considering the examples of France, Sweden, Luxembourg, the average life expectancy stands **as high as 82**. Similarly, the infant mortality rate in Hungary as of a report of 2017 was **3.8 deaths per 1000 live births**. The case is true with many other European nations. All these figures reflect the competence of the European healthcare system.

European countries have different policies and regulations when it comes to health provisions. Nonetheless, every measure taken by the EU in the field of health is in public interest. It is significant to note that a citizen of any EU country has equal access to healthcare facilities of all the other member countries. Assuming that one owns a [**Hungarian Passport**](https://www.eupassport.in/hungary-citizenship) but at the same time he wants to avail benefits of the German healthcare system, this demand of his can easily be met being an [**EU citizen**](https://www.eupassport.in/blog/european-citizenship).

Talking specifically of Hungary, the healthcare facilities, undoubtedly, are among the best. Hungary is a healthy country with average life expectancy touching 76. Hungary spends around **8% of its GDP on healthcare and wellness services**. Hungarians enjoy a tax-funded universal health care system. With more patient-centered care, Hungary aims at providing effective and safe treatment with the use of modern equipment. The healthcare is financed by **Healthcare Insurance Fund (HIF)** which benefits people with a weak financial background and physically or mentally handicapped people. Coverage is universal irrespective of the employment or financial status. Individuals studying or working in Hungary are protected under public healthcare. They are entitled to free healthcare just like the nationals of the country.

The country has developed competent and satisfactory health infrastructure. With the introduction of **air ambulances** in almost every hospital and with advanced equipment, the Hungarian healthcare system boasts an effective and capable infrastructure. Emergency services in Hungary are also satisfactory. The ambulance does not take much time to reach an emergency site, **15 minutes maximum**. The pharmaceutical industry in Hungary is tremendously big which further contributes to the healthcare economy of the country. The individuals also enjoy certain subsidies on public sector pharmacies.

Medical tourism has also flourished in Hungary to an unimaginable extent. The reason for it can be Hungary’s competent healthcare infrastructure or even inexpensive health maintenance services. The country specializes in dental tourism providing affordable and top quality dentistry services. Other popular treatments also include cosmetic and orthopedic surgery, fertility care, and dermatology and anti-aging treatments. Hungary is also known for its several medicinal spas. Spa care is giving a good push to the health business.

Hungary has achieved a lot in the field of health protection.

812,fz2of6,europe,"Sintesis of an article appeared today on Il Sole 24 Ore (Italian business newspaper) ""The secret file that reveals the Dutch system"" April 11, 2020",19,,1586602952,News,0,"Journalists Mincuzzi and Galullo claim to have come into possession of a copy of a confidential report of an intelligence company that would reveal ""incestuous"" relations between politicians and entrepreneurs, ""divisions and opaque affairs"" reminiscent of the Italy of Mani pulite.

&amp;#x200B;

Such a report would present a country far removed from the rigorous one, based on a model of free market economy, which is proposed to us by its leaders: Rutte and his finance minister Hoeskra. Instead, it would be outside a country where personal and economic interests are cemented and walk the ""red carpet stretched by multinationals"".

&amp;#x200B;

""Legend has it that when EU ambassadors pass the baton to each other, they recommend their successor to sit in silence at the public assemblies in which they take part. Wait for the moment of deliberation, look at your Dutch colleague and vote exactly the opposite"". This does not apply to Germany, Hungary and Luxembourg, almost always faithful comrades from the Netherlands in the European Union.

&amp;#x200B;

The report on which this article is based was commissioned two years ago, when Amsterdam won the Ema headquarters in Milan. After three votes with the same number of preferences, the draw rewarded the Netherlands.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the match, it turns out that Holland presented an unworkable project for the construction of the temporary buildings that should house the EMA headquarters. The project that allowed Holland to be awarded the Ema headquarters was immediately modified. Appeals are being lodged which, as is well known, will not change the outcome of the draw. Therefore, it is after this opaque manoeuvre, that an intelligence company is asked to investigate under the surface of the political decisions taken by Mark Rutte. The company moves by contacting dozens of deep gorges along the Amsterdam-Brussels axis.

&amp;#x200B;

The contract for the construction of the definitive seat of EMA is won by an entrepreneurial company, Dura Vermeer, founded in 1855, the same company which led - becoming a very important economic centre - the reconstruction of the country at the end of the Second World War. Two companies are presented at the tender. The other withdraws in February because it claims that delivery times are too tight to build the 19-storey tower of the headquarters (cost 250 million euros).

&amp;#x200B;

The report then indicates the revolving ports that connect the political world to that of the multinationals, a report that feeds gigantic conflicts of interest. And from the multinationals come Hoekstra and Rutte. The latter, after graduating in 1992, joined Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch multinational company. He then moved on to a company controlled by Calvé and finally moved on to a subsidiary of Unilever as personnel manager. From this company -- Iglomora -- he moved on to politics.

&amp;#x200B;

Hoekstra starts in Shell working between Berlin, Hamburg and Rotterdam, then moves on to McKinsey and comes to politics. The article talks about the existence of a secret lobby -- Abdup -- which would include Unilever, Shell, Philips and government members.

&amp;#x200B;

Addup meets in a hotel in The Hague twice a year: at the first one the national directors of multinationals meet with their legal advisors. The second would be the ""presidents' meeting"" where the meeting takes place between government members and CEOs.

&amp;#x200B;

The 'meeting of presidents', which involves the Prime Minister, is very quick and structured. It lasts 90 minutes. There is a 10-minute introduction and four 20-minute speeches in which the various points such as sustainability issues and dividend taxation of multinationals are discussed. These meetings were attended not only by the current PM Rutte, but also by his former finance ministers Verhagen; former Eurogroup president and former finance minister Kees de Jager (who, at the end of his political career, became CFO of the telephone company Kpn).

&amp;#x200B;

The intelligence report

&amp;#x200B;

The words of R.O. (Director of the Ministry of General Affairs): ""In the Netherlands the distance between political decision-makers and the economy is practically non-existent"". The corrupt practice exercised through bribes is not recent but dates back as far as 2004 when magistrates discovered a link between builders and public executives who pocketed 1.5% of the total value of the works awarded.

&amp;#x200B;

T.T. of a major Dutch authority talks about '30 years of illegal practices of a large Dutch company \[...\] a businessman set up special bank accounts with a bank to pay high level politicians and bureaucrats. The accounts were opened in the name of companies but in fact individual politicians and state managers can draw on them. This practice has been going on for 40 years. Kept by a solid chain of secrecy.

&amp;#x200B;

In essence it is decided ""Which company will win which bid, according to a certain balance, whose rules are still unknown, because the public ministries have never tried to find out"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Italy is often thought of as the rebel in Eurozone. Flaunting the budget rules, domestic policies whenever not masochistic enough get intense scrutiny from the media across the continent. Commission's recommendation papers seem like toilet paper down in Rome. Or at least that is what they would like us to believe. Nothing could be further from the truth. Italy kept closer to the EMU macroeconomic code of practice than France and Germany and paid heavily for this: the permanent state of fiscal austerity, the drastic deregulation of labor markets and the overvalued exchange rate killed Italian aggregate demand—and the demand shortage asphyxiated growth of Italian output, incomes, jobs, and productivity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Italy: the Eurozone’s poster child

&amp;#x200B;

The early 90s were marked, at least initially, by strong fears that Italy could not and would not meet the conditions for membership of the European Monetary Union, specified in the Treaty of Maastricht. Italy’s public finances are a mess: the public debt-to-GDP ratio is approaching 100%-mark and interest rates payments on Italian bonds represent more than 10 per cent of GDP. **Result of incredibly misguided macroeconomic policies in the past, especially the “divorzio” which would catapult borrowing costs for Italy to never before seen levels. As a stark example of irony, the decision of the central bank to raise interest rates in the 1980s, intended to attract capital inflows from abroad, needed to keep the lira within the EMU band, fueled the debt which is now jeopardizing the Italian position in the Eurozone.**

&amp;#x200B;

*In 1981 the government decided that the Bank of Italy would no longer be forced to buy any residual treasury bonds that the market refused to absorb. This meant that monetary financing of fiscal policy would now no longer be an obligation, but at best a voluntary choice of the central bank. The measure was aimed at forcing public deficit reduction. It was also intended as an anti-inflationary move because the “divorce” would give the Bank of Italy better control over the money supply. Interestingly, the divorce was never debated in parliament, but was implemented through an exchange of letters between the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Ciampi, and the Minister of the Treasury, Andreatta.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To allay those fears, especially of financial markets, the Italian government put through an unprecedented program of fiscal consolidation, involving expenditure cuts and (tax) revenue increases amounting to nearly 6 per cent of GDP, as well as far-reaching—albeit partial— reforms of Italy’s labor markets, which were intended to curb nominal wage and price increases and improve the country’s international cost competitiveness by weakening the collective wage bargaining power of unions, ending the automatic indexation of nominal wages to inflation, and ultimately restraining wage growth.

&amp;#x200B;

No other Eurozone economy managed to bring about a transformation of its mixed economy as radically as Italy, which in major ways acted more Catholic than the (Brussels) Pope. Successive Italian governments of different political colors implemented deregulatory policy and institutional reforms, often with limited parliamentary support and lacking popular consensus, while trying to shift the blame and responsibility on ‘binding commitments’ or ‘external constraints’ imposed by far-off ‘Brussels’. Italian elite saw the European Union as a way for the country’s political economy to “liberalize”.

&amp;#x200B;

As the Guido Carli, Italy’s economic minister during the years of 1989 to 1992 later wrote in his memoirs:

&amp;#x200B;

*The European Union implies . . . the abandonment of the mixed economy, the abandonment of economic planning, the redefinition of the modalities of composition of public expenditure, the restriction of the powers of parliamentary assemblies in favor of government . . . the repudiation of the concept of free social provisions (and the subsequent reform of healthcare and social security systems) . . . the reduction of the presence of the state in the financial and industrial systems . . . the abandonment of price controls and tariffs.*

&amp;#x200B;

The country may rightly be called the star pupil in the Eurozone class, because it radically altered its political economy and moulded itself into what it is today—abandoning its mixed economy, scaling down its healthcare and social insurance systems, liberalizing its financial and industrial systems, and limiting democratic and parliamentary control over its macroeconomic policies.

&amp;#x200B;

[Government spending since 1991- Italy, Germany, France](https://preview.redd.it/zzf1h15fwcc51.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=631b6e9b7187146a0ad6b9bcb4fe64491f7d401b)

# Size of fiscal adjustments

&amp;#x200B;

In February 1992, Italy signed the Maastricht Treaty. The treaty imposed much tighter constraints than anything introduced before. The central bank would be explicitly prevented from lending to governments, as a matter of treaty obligation. The fixed but adjustable parities of the EMS would be replaced by the most inflexible of exchange rate arrangements: a common currency.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, the economic governance model embedded in the treaty was de facto (although not de jure) incompatible with the modus operandi of state-owned enterprises.

&amp;#x200B;

What followed seven months later was a historic currency crisis and four years of enormous debt expansion, annualized at 6.5 % per year. **With GDP growth strangled by interest rate hikes and fast fiscal consolidation coupled with consequently falling inflation, the now set in stone interest expenditure drove the debt into the sky.**

&amp;#x200B;

That debt bonanza made Italian government pursuit permanent process of fiscal consolidation, reflecting a remarkable political commitment to ‘sufficiently diminish’ public indebtedness ‘at a satisfactory pace’, which brought down the public debt ratio from 117%  in 1995 to 103% in 2002 and less than 100% in 2007.

&amp;#x200B;

[Fiscal adjustments as percent of GDP](https://preview.redd.it/08n7k0ajwcc51.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359c72379c636d6b07ef15b5167d53d4121e8ca2)


From 1995 to 2008, various Italian governments shared this commitment to debt sustainability and ran substantial primary budget surpluses (defined as public expenditure excluding interest payments on public debt, minus public revenue), **averaging 3 per cent of GDP per year during a period of fourteen years.**

&amp;#x200B;

The permanent primary surpluses by themselves would have reduced Italy’s public debt-to-GDP ratio by almost 40 percentage points—from 117% in 1995 to 77% in 2008 (keeping other factors constant). Within the Eurozone, the degree of fiscal consolidation by Italy was extraordinary: France ran a primary deficit of 0.1% of GDP each year on average during 1995-2008, which modestly raised its public debt-to-GDP ratio. The German government, upholding the common-sensical budgetary philosophy of the proverbial ‘Swabian housewife’, did run a primary surplus, but of only 0.7% of GDP per year; this reduced Germany’s public debt-to-GDP ratio by 8.7 percentage points (or one-fifth of Italy’s effort) during 1995-2008 (keeping other factors constant).

&amp;#x200B;

Why didn't debt-to-GDP ratio decline by 40 percentage points? The answer lies in the effects running substantial primary surpluses had on growth. **Slow GDP growth relative to the high-interest rate , pushed up Italy’s public debt-to-GDP ratio by 23 percentage points, destroying more than half of the debt-to-GDP reduction.**

&amp;#x200B;

There are a couple of structural reasons why fiscal readjustment was so unsuccessful.

&amp;#x200B;

The importance of domestic demand and wage-driven growth model, the model where the most important growth component is wage growth, which results in increasing household consumption and high productivity growth, is more prevalent in Italy/South than in the northern countries.

&amp;#x200B;

As depressed domestic demand weighed heavily on the economy, there was nothing to offset it. Italy could not count on external demand(see below) but only on higher private or public borrowing, promoting either would be seen as counterintuitive.

&amp;#x200B;

**Italy’s exports are estimated to be highly sensitive to movements of the real exchange rate (with an elasticity of about –1.5 percent).** ([1](https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/italej/v4y2018i3d10.1007_s40797-018-0075-5.html)) Due to the exchange rate elasticity Italian export demand enjoys, loss of competitiveness was a natural response to unfavourable currency valuation that came with Euro. Evidently seen in lagging Italian export growth since 1996.

&amp;#x200B;

That effect was compounded by the fact that Italian firms are operating in global markets that are more strongly exposed to the growing competition of low-wage countries and China in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

As a consequence northern countries could substitute decreasing domestic demand with foreign much easier without having to worry about currency re-valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent evidence suggests that Italian exporters are beginning to upgrade the quality of their products ([2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320471042_Back_on_Track_A_Macro-Micro_Narrative_of_Italian_Exports)). **And yet the main hurdles that Italian exporters must overcome persist, including overvalued currency, the inexorable increase in competition from emerging low-wage economies, and lack of domestic demand growth due to the perpetual austerity and permanent wage restraint.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\\* That is all for now. The next post will discuss the size and effects of structural reforms and forces driving the Italian demand decline. \\\*

French and Brazilian ties was very bad after [Bolsonaro canceled a meeting with Jean-Yves Le Drian](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/chanceler-frances-ironiza-urgencia-capilar-de-bolsonaro-23854077). That's the context, now let's go to when the hysteria began: with Macron's tweet in the dry season and how it is a lie.

How is it a lie? First of all, it is not a picture from Amazon nowadays. [It is a picture from 80's](https://g1.globo.com/fato-ou-fake/noticia/2019/08/22/veja-o-que-e-fato-ou-fake-sobre-as-queimadas-na-amazonia.ghtml), from a photographer who died in 2003. This is not that important as an argument, but it shows how Macron wanted to make an impact with his tweet, not shows what is happening. The important part is:

**AMAZON IS NOT THE LUNG OF THE WORLD NEITHER PRODUCES 20% OF WORLD OXYGEN**. Amazon is the lung of Amazon, [all oxygen produced by Amazon trees is consumed by Amazon itself](https://super.abril.com.br/ciencia/a-amazonia-nao-e-o-pulmao-do-mundo/). 

[**TROPICAL FORESTS PER SE PRODUCE MORE CARBON THAN THEY CONSUME**](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/tropical-forests-carbon-rise-oxygen-study-climate-change-emissions-a7974941.html). Amazon trees are old and soil isn't rich anymore. Trees being old means that they don't absorve as much as they were used to do and the soil not being as good as it was once means that the relation of trees dying and trees growing is not the same. Density/biomass of Amazon will naturally decrease. The carbon emission in Amazon due to storms only is about [86% of Amazon carbon consume](https://www.livescience.com/44235-amazon-rainforest-carbon-cycle-measured.html).

 

**WRONG NUMBER IN IMPORTANT NEWSPAPERS**

[Reuters:](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-environment-wildfires/amazon-burning-brazil-reports-record-forest-fires-idUSKCN1VA1UK) BRASILIA (Reuters) - Wildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest have hit a record number this year, with **72,843 fires** detected so far by Brazil’s space research center INPE, as concerns grow over right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro’s environmental policy.

[Independent:](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/amazon-fires-brazil-jair-bolsonaro-emmanuel-macron-rainforest-g7-summit-a9075681.html) Brazil’s space research centre, Inpe, has detected **72,843 fires** in the Amazon so far this year.

The number of fires in Amazon at that time was about 40 thousands, [According to INPE](http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal/estatistica_estados):

Hope the ad-hoc translation is okay and nothing of the humour gets lost! Links were swapped for what I consider useful English-language equivalents.

**On the Power of Mind**

Uri Geller, the mentalist with Israeli citizenship and British residence, [has announced plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/b4akxu/uri_geller_promises_to_stop_brexit_using_telepathy/) to finally resolve the infinite chaos in UK politics and prevent Brexit by the sheer power of his mind. On one hand, this is pretty nice, but on the other it raises two questions: How exactly is [Geller, who in the 70s became conspicuous as a notorious spoonbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller), but not a global problem solver, going to achieve this? And: What exactly is a mentalist?

Well, mentalists are people who ascribe to themselves paranormal abilities and claim to be able to influence the physical world simply by imagining the change hard enough. Traffic minister Andreas Scheuer, for example, is one such person: He believes he is able to reduce CO2 emissions that way.

With Brexit, Geller imagines the following: Every morning and evening, exactly at 11am and 11pm, Brits should imagine the face of Theresa May. (This isn't exactly a pleasant task, but it should be possible, similar to brushing one's teeth twice a day.) Geller would then direct the emerging energy into the head of the prime minister, May would declare a second referendum, and the Brits will vote No on Brexit. (At the time of editorial deadline, it seemed more likely that instead of Brexit, May would disappear.)

Uri Geller already noticed at the tender age of five that he'd belong to the chosen ones, when he was hit by a flash of light and when, later that day, the spoon in his hand bent itself whilst he was eating dinner. Allegedly, these powers were granted to him by aliens from the planet Hoova. At this point, one should mention that some critics consider mentalists to be charlatans. We don't belong to them. We trust Uri Geller.

Because: Believing until the very last second that the impossible will happen and everything will turn out for the better? This is no quirk. This is a good tradition of German social democracy. To expect in spite of lousy polls even on election day to be declared the winner, comrades are proficient at this. Geller does not belong onto the couch, he belongs into the SPD (even if this is not a big difference). In any case, the power of suggestion is a great force of politics. Only if Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer convinces herself every day that she can chancellor, she has any chances to succeed. For this she is willing to bend as impressively as Geller's spoons.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropa

With no clear indication made by the artist nor by the official presentation, various interpretations of a single country can be drawn, and this list is by no means definite. Some of the physical pieces differ slightly from the form presented in the official booklet:

Austria, a known opponent of atomic energy, is depicted as a green field dominated by nuclear power plant cooling towers with vapour coming out of them at intervals.[7]

Belgium is presented as a box of half-eaten Praline chocolates with the pattern of Brussels waffles.
Bulgaria is depicted by a series of connected ""Turkish"" squat toilets with neon lights connecting and illuminating them. This piece of the sculpture was later hidden with fabric.[8][9]

Cyprus is cut in half.

The Czech Republic's own piece is an LED display, which flashes controversial quotations by Czech President Václav Klaus.

Denmark is depicted as being built out of Lego bricks, and some claim to see in the depiction a face reminiscent of the cartoon controversy,[10] though the resemblance has been denied by Černý.[11]

Estonia is presented with power tools resembling a hammer and sickle, citing the country's consideration of a ban on Communist symbols.[12]

Finland is depicted as a wooden floor including a male with a rifle lying down, imagining an elephant, a hippo and a crocodile.[13]

France is draped in a ""GRÈVE!"" (""STRIKE!"") banner.[8]

Germany is a series of interlocking autobahns with cars moving about on them, described as ""somewhat resembling a swastika"",[8][14][15] though the statement is not universally accepted.[16] Some Czech military historians also suggest that the autobahns resemble the number ""18"", which some Neo-nazi groups use as code for A.H., the initials of Adolf Hitler.[17]

Greece is depicted as a forest that has been entirely burned, possibly representing the 2007 Greek forest fires or the 2008 civil unrest in Greece.[18]

Hungary features an Atomium consisting of watermelons and Hungarian sausages, based on a floor of peppers.

Ireland is depicted as a brown bog with bagpipes protruding from Northern Ireland. The bagpipes also play music in five-minute intervals.[citation needed]

Italy is depicted as a football pitch[8] with several players who appear to be masturbating, possibly indicating what some see as the country's ""fetish for football"".[15]

Latvia is shown as covered with mountains, in contrast to its actual flat landscape.

Lithuania includes a series of dressed Manneken Pis-style figures urinating, with the streams of urine being illuminated by yellow glass fibres.

Luxembourg is displayed as a gold nugget with a ""For Sale"" sign.[8]

Malta is depicted as a tiny island with a prehistoric dwarf elephant, as well as a magnifying glass in front of the elephant.

The Netherlands is depicted as having disappeared under the sea with only several minarets still visible.[8]

Poland has a piece with priests erecting the rainbow flag of the gay rights movement on a field of potatoes in the style of the famous photograph Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.[19]

Portugal is shown as a wooden cutting board with three pieces of meat in the shape of its former colonies of Brazil, Angola, and Mozambique.

Romania is a Dracula-style theme park, which is set up to blink and emit ghostly sounds at intervals.[8]

Slovakia is depicted as a Hungarian sausage (or a human body wrapped in Hungarian tricolor).
Slovenia is shown as a rock engraved with the words ""First Tourists Came Here, 1213"".

Spain is covered entirely in concrete, with a concrete mixer situated in the north-east.[20]

Sweden, unlike the other pieces in the sculpture, does not have an outline, but is instead represented as a large IKEA-style self-assembly furniture box containing Gripen fighter planes (as supplied to the Czech Air Force).[21]

The United Kingdom, known for its Euroscepticism and relative isolation from Europe, is ""included"" as a missing piece (an empty space) at the top-left of the sculpture.[8]

Truer words have never been spoken. London is a city that vibrates with life. The constant hustle and bustle is both exhausting and intoxicating. But, this is the joy of the city. And, to experience London is to walk the fine line between the two, discovering all its treasures along the way. So, without further ado, here’s a 36 hours guide to one of Europe’s most exciting cities.

&amp;#x200B;

[London](https://i.redd.it/fsbtxa0h20k11.jpg)

**Friday Night** 

Your flight, train, bus or whatever it is you traveled in on has landed or pulled into the station. You’ve made your way to your hotel or Airbnb, dropped your stuff off only to hear your belly grumble. It’s pushing on a bit, and hunger is setting in. In short, it’s time to get a bite to eat.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Friday night fish n’ chips - Toff’s**

Don’t be put off by the name; you’re not likely to come across any monocle wearing, top hat sporting members of the upper echelons of society here. And, that’s not to discredit this fine eating establishment tucker. Nestled away in the sleepy suburb of Muswell Hill, Toff’s serves up the best fish and chips in the whole darn country. Scratch that, the world. This family-run restaurant uses sustainably sourced fish, cooks it to order and makes use of a traditional (the way it should be) batter recipe. Service is fast and friendly. check our [best fish and chips](https://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/londons-best-fish-and-chip-restaurants) in London.

&amp;#x200B;

**Saturday Morning** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Breakfast - The Breakfast Club** 

You know what they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. So, head on over to any one of the branches of this breakfast cafe chain dotted throughout London and whose name derives from the classic John Hughes movie. Indulge in pancakes, a full English or their delicious oatmeal porridge; you’ll need the energy for the day ahead.  

&amp;#x200B;

[English Brekfast](https://i.redd.it/p77cpgzn20k11.jpg)

**Stroll down Southbank** 

Southbank’s riverside promenade is a two-mile stretch buzzing with life and brimming with cultural institutions. A walk by the water in the mid-morning sun is beautiful and refreshing. There are plenty of cafes to stop off at for a quick coffee and a short bout of people watching before moving into one of the area’s fantastic galleries. 

&amp;#x200B;

**A touch of culture - Tate Modern** 

Like all of London’s museums, the Tate modern is completely free. You can spend hours exploring the former Bankside power station’s permanent exhibitions which consist of international contemporary and modern art. 

&amp;#x200B;

**And a little more - Hayward Gallery** 

Set behind the British Film Institute, which houses one of the best arthouses cinemas in all of London, is the Hayward Gallery. Housed behind the walls of this striking example of brutalist architecture, visitors can check out programmed events or temporary exhibitions. Currently, and running through until October, the venue is hosting a photography exhibition that features the work of more than 30 artists who have used drag to explore and question identity, gender, class, and politics. Find more information of europe museums and galleries at [dotravel](https://dotravel.com/).

&amp;#x200B;

**Lunch - Boxpark** 

Head across the river and up a little way up into east London's trendy Shoreditch neighborhood. Make your way to box park (it sits next to the Shoreditch High Street Station), a collection of old shipping containers that have been transformed to house boutique shops, bars, and food stalls. Here, you can pick and choose what you feel like chowing down on. You’ll find everything from falafels to burgers. Once you’ve made your choice, settle into the communal seating areas and tuck in.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Explore Shoreditch** 

Shoreditch is a strange and exciting place. A horrific example of gentrification and pretension, but somehow it still manages to retain a level of charm and allure. The place is ripe with hip pop-up shops selling overpriced enamel kitchenware and tea-tree beard oils. Go down Bricklane and cut into any number of vintage clothes and record shops that line the streets, before hitting Spitalfields market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pick up a gift - Spitalfields Market** 

This is one of London’s oldest markets and now operates seven days a week. Labeling itself a “traders market,” Spitalfields boasts stalls that sells some spectacular stuff. From hand-stitched alpaca scarves to natural soaps, Spitalfields is the perfect place to pick up a gift for a friend or, hey, even yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

[Spitalfields Market](https://i.redd.it/v38u9ztt20k11.jpg)

**Time for a Drink - The Sun Tavern** 

Just up from Bethnal Green Station, a hop skip and a step from Spitalfields market is the Sun Tavern. This cool little pub was first established in 1851 and reopened in 2014. It is said the Kray twins owned the building. They serve a fine selection of cocktails and craft beers, as well as the Irish, distilled liquor, Poitin, which if you’ve never had the pleasure of tasting, is a must.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Sun Tavern](https://i.redd.it/8toucgr630k11.jpg)

**Dinner - Hurwundeki** 

Head around the corner down to Cambridge Heath to Hurwundeki for a restaurant unlike any you’ll have ever experienced. This little joint serves as a hairdresser during the day but come night the stoves are fired up, the kitchen comes to life, and hot bowls of Korean food are ferried out to tables of hungry patrons. Go for the bibimbap; it's excellent. The place is BYOB, so pick yourself up a bottle of something from one of the nearby offies if you’re so inclined. 

 

**Dance it up - The Old Queens Head** 

A short bus ride from Shoreditch and your into the Angel/Islington area of London where down on Essex Road sits The Old Queens Head. Not only is this fantastic pub/club home to the oldest fireplace in all of London, but it also boasts three floors of fun.  

The ground floor is a pub, kitted out with comfy old sofas and plenty of tables and stools. Upstairs is an intimate club space, with another bar, that goes off after 10.00. And, the next floor up is a private karaoke room that you can hire for the night. Or, if you’ve got the big bucks, you can also rent the private playroom which is fitted with video game consoles, foosball tables, and a dartboard. The best bit is both rooms come with “room” service, meaning you don’t have to make endless trips up and down the stairs to get the rounds in. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Old Queens Head ](https://i.redd.it/dc8q481030k11.jpg)

The bars serve a fantastic selection of draught beers with a couple rotating taps. The fridges are stuffed with craft beers and the bartenders, who are a super friendly bunch, known their way around a cocktail menu too.  

Depending on the night you can expect to hear the DJs spin everything from pop classics to hip-hop and R&amp;B, guaranteeing a night of solid boogying.

At 2 am, when they chuck you out, it’s time to head home. It’s been a long day of adventure, and everyone needs their beauty sleep. Including you. Good night.",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9ckevn/36_hours_in_london/,7

Why is Germany who is a very green country so anti nuclear, the greenest electricity around. In which world is replacing coal with gas in any way a more environmentally friendly solution. The pollution is just shifted from one country (Germany) to another (Russia)

Even if Germany shifts all its attention to create renewable (excluding nuclear) energy the chances of them creating 50% of their energy requirements with wind and sun in 2 decades is very slim. So they are building a pipeline for gas..... somebody did not think this through.

In times of crisis like this I feel that the rise of euroskepticism and nationalism in hardest hit countries is inevitable,since it's so much easier for every politician to create an external ""enemy"",to switch responsibility and blame the EU  or other EU countries for current and future problems that may arise from this crisis. Now,I am not saying the EU is not to blame at all,EU has flaws,it is guilty for the slow and incomplete reaction to this crisis but I think that it is not fair to blame it for every single internal problem,like it saddens me to read here on some subreddits and on the news how everyone is pointing fingers at each other,blaming each other(but mostly EU).

I'll give an example,I can't speak for other countries,I don't want to generalize,but currently in my country(which is an supposedly an EU candidate) in recent months every freaking politician has started blaming and subtly hating the EU for anything and everything,the coronavirus is for them just another excuse to blame the EU for not helping them(even though the EU has invested heavily in every segment of society in  the past years) and now they praise China for an act ""of brotherly unending love bound by blood and history""(our president said something like that) while failing to see that its just interests and politics,soft power simply. Every news outlet,everywhere on the internet suddenly China not only our friend,but a brother, a country to look up to.Suddenly,China and Russia are true selfless helpers that care for our people while EU is the bad guy that doesn't give a shit.Even though Russia and especially China have done countless crimes against humanity in recent years against their own people that I don't have  to mention,but everyone forgot that in my country,no one is reporting about HK protests,Uyghur concentration camps and them hiding the true scale of the epidemic. 

I have read something similar happening in some other EU countries(Italy for example).I think that people just don't see what China and Russia really are doing. My opinion is that They don't care about us or our lives,they're trying to destabilize and divide EU,they are spreading their influence and power 'cause it the simple ""Divide and rule"" tactic.

I think the people have forgotten the importance of EU and the European unity.We need to look at our common history and what we have achieved together.First of all,I believe peace and security is the basis for everything and Europe has NEVER known so long a period without war. In 20th century alone two world wars have been fought on our soil.Milions of people have died and even if we go back another 300-400 years yet more milions have died.Afaik  one of the reasons EU was founded was to prevent more wars and it has been successful so far.We have the benefits of the advanced Single Market,human rights,high food and environmental standards,social benefits etc.From an economic perspective most EU countries have high standards of living and are developed in many other areas of economics,culture,freedoms,green energy etc.There's many other benefits that i dont have the time to mention now and even don't really know about.Even the post communist countries that joined the EU some time after the fall of USSR have advanced  tremendously in every aspect. You could argue that they could've done it even without being a member of EU but I am certain that atleast some of that development is thanks to EU.Another important thing that comes to mind is that separately we are all small countries when compared to gigants like US and Russia,and even countries with evergrowing economic and political might and influence like China,India,Brazil.We have to face the fact that divided we are small and insignificant,unable to have major influence on the global stage. I think we are in a stronger position in the world if we are in a club of 0,5 billion people.Individually,countries like Germany,France,Spain would still wield some influence and power but what about smaller Baltic countries like Lithuania,Estonia,Latvia?They would probably be  swallowed by Russia and its influence.

 Finally, I do not believe it comes down to power alone.I believe in the ideals of the EU. I believe the EU stands for something beyond nationalism, beyond our individual identities. European values, and these are not exclusive to Europe, are, for me, about tolerating religious, national, gender, ethnic and other differences and recognizing that we have far more in common than the things which divide us. I want to see a Europe that is more prosperous, greener, kinder, more just, fairer, and which promotes these values on the world stage. But most importantly I believe the EU is not perfect,not at all,it has problems,it has flaws many of which people of this very subreddit are pointing out everyday,it has flaws but I believe we should not simply leave it,we should work on it and improve it in every way we can 'cause after all if we go into enough detail we are all connected in some degree culturally,historically,linguistically and genetically. You know that cliche saying ""United we stand,divided we fall"".

1082,getnkr,europe,Use the green new deal to avoid secondary effects after the pandemic,1,1.0,1588802611,,0,"We all know we're not there yet, maybe there's an easing and there could be further peaks and valleys before the health crisis is over.  But at some point it will be over and need a plan so when we come through this there's light at the end of the tunnel instead of the challenges of a pandemic being replaced by  social issues, loss of quality of life, unemployment, lack of security

One opportunity to get things going again would be to dovetail the EU green deal.  There's a lot of residences that have a low energy rating and addressing that helps towards the green new deals objectives.  The green new deal already has a budget which can be used to extend finance to those projects.  If we require or incentivise improvements then that will create a lot of work for small and medium construction business who employ people in the community.   It will also make for a cleaner planet 

Plus, if we're really smart about it, we can find ways to have those building projects use EU manufactured materials, solar panels, insulation, etc so there's a double employment benefit + an eccologic benefit from not transporting building materials around the world.

Wont solve everything, but it seems a way to orientate an existing initiative so it helps people back on their feet",[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/getnkr/use_the_green_new_deal_to_avoid_secondary_effects/,1

1164,xb7gd8,europe,Elections in Sweden Megathread,0,1.0,1662865130,,0,"Today, September 11th, the citizens of Sweden go to polls to vote in the general elections! 

Swedish parliament (unicameral *Riksdag*) consists of 349 members (175 needed for majority). The electoral system used in voting is open list proportional representation, with 4% electoral threshold, for a **four**-year term. Seats are allocated using a modification of [Sainte-Laguë method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method#Modified_Sainte-Lagu.C3.AB_method), with 90% (310) being fixed to electoral constituencies, and remaining 39 „adjustment seats” distributed among the parties to ensure proportional representation.

It’s worth mentioning, that concurrently with parliamentary elections, today are also happening **local** elections - to councils (*landsting*) of 20 counties, and assemblies of 290 municipalities. While to vote in parliamentary elections, one must be a Swedish citizen, local ones are open to Swedish residents who are citizens of any EU country, as well as Norway or Iceland.

Turnout in last (2018) elections was 87.2%, which was the highest since 1985.

Relevant parties and alliances taking part in the elections are:

1294,7nuqok,europe,Mountains Matter,0,,1514987354,,0,"Mountains Matter

11th December is International Mountain Day. What exactly mountains matter for? Hiking or climbing might be the fastest things to come to mind about them, but this is not all mountains presents to residents of this planet.

Almost 80 percent of Earth’s fresh water originates in the mountains. All major rivers of the globe are fed from mountain resources.

Mountains also play a role of canopies and provide home to more than 900 hundred million people and a huge variety of animals; many of them useful to humankind. Honeybees residing among the rocks or other mountainous regions are known for the highest quality of honey, as an example.

Vegetation is another invaluable present of mountains to us, forests produce fresh air and wood; a very useful material seen almost everywhere in our lives.

Mountains are home to mines too. For centuries now, industries have provided necessary minerals and raw materials from mines.

Humans however, the smartest and at the same time worsts residents of this planet are destroying the mountains too.

Expansion of farming lands in mountainous areas has resulted in soil erosion, in addition to endangering vegetation and wildlife. This endangerment raises with our livestock grazing in mountainous areas as they invade wild animal’s territory and ruin certain types of plants.

Another threat to mountains is logging. Mountainous forests are not just home to wildlife or dams in times of flood or avalanche, they are natural air fresheners, and in fact they play the role of lungs for this planet.

Humans moreover cause numerous troubles as campers and hikers. Just in May 2017 more than 4 tons of rubbish were removed from Mount Everest.

Reports also show that as many as 90 per cent of wildfires begin simply with a careless human leaving a burning cigarette in forests, or not completely putting out a campfire.

Global warming caused by industries threatens glaciers mostly residing in mountains and this means threatening an average 70 per cent of our water resources.

All mentioned above, added to mining and its expansion need reconsideration and appropriate measures taken by people from all around the globe and it will not happen without raising environmental awareness. Everyone should make sense that “If we build too much, we will destroy.”

1298,7v1tai,europe,"[Polish Television] This is how tax funded, main 24/7 news channel reports on recent Trump-FBI 'conflict' (short translation of interview)",7,,1517689278,,0,"Hi,

First, let me say I’m not sure this is right subreddit – maybe you guys can link it somewhere more fitting. It’s my first post (long time lurker though, just never really needed to sign up). 

I’d like to show you something, so those of you who care (and if you don’t – it’s OK) can gain some perspective on the kind of narration about Trump and current situation in US, which is pushed by national, tax funded media outlets in Poland (TVP).

There was [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7l7wa3/this_is_how_polish_television_looks_like/) some time ago (I think it was on top of r/all at one point) and you may heard that our right-wing party (Law and Justice) has full control over every branch of government (but that’s not enough, it seems lately), and they are also in charge of biggest TV channels.


**Following transcript is not from satire** – first 40 min of [this]( https://vod.tvp.pl/video/minela-dwudziesta,01022018,35849911)  panel, aired Thursday 2/1/18, is literally about holocaust. Translated part of interview starts at 52 min.


Interviewed man is Wojciech Cejrowski – he has quite large fanbase in Poland, mainly because he is bestselling author of books about travelling and host of many globetrotter-type TV shows. But for reasons unknown to me, he became ‘TV expert’ on just about *everything*. Drug politics? Invite Cejrowski to debate. Gun control? Cejrowski (he advocates on every occasion how Poland should adopt gun legislation from ‘red’ US states, also he has a house in Arizona - I guess that’s why he is now ‘TVP American correspondent’ on regular basis). Global warming? Cejrowski (he doesn’t believe it, I’ve just found interview on YT, dated 2017, where he states: *‘…whole human civilization emits less CO2 than one volcano, and there is hundreds volcanoes on earth’*). Vaccination? Cejrowski. Abortions?  Yep, that too, he is of course hardcore pro-life.
You get the picture. 
He’s just keep getting invited whenever there is some ‘hot’ topic, on which media wants to show ‘hot’ discussion.


But that’s not really the point of this post. **The point is:** people in TVP know very well who Mr. Cejrowski is, and this interview was aired during evening prime-time, on tax funded, main news station. Please note, it currently has best coverage in terms of numbers of households reached, among 24/7 news channels in Poland (private-owned TVN24 being second). You may also note how the show host legitimizes Mr. Cejrowski points to viewers.


[Translation is mine; I put some additional info in brackets]

[START around 00:52:00 – [link to the official TVP website](https://vod.tvp.pl/video/minela-dwudziesta,01022018,35849911) ]


**HOST:** So, the deputy director of the FBI [Andrew McCabe] stepped down on Monday – tell us more about that and explain what’s the deal with Donald Trump tweet about McCabe’s wife’s campaign donations and her connections with Hillary Clinton


**MR. CEJROWSKI:** Look, I myself would have fired him long time ago, but in US they respect the rule of law, so it takes time. Even when someone does some wrongdoing but you don’t have specific, lawful reason to fire him, you just don’t do it; even to put pressure on such person is frowned upon. But to be honest, he should not work in FBI at all since his wife got substantial funding from, well, Clintons. So get this: the same time [McCabe] investigated Trump, his wife got money from Clintons. This is classic, so called conflict of interests. In my opinion, guy should have resigned himself long ago, you know, put himself out of the way. In fact, most people in American administration would do exactly that for sure, given situation like this. You just say, ‘Hey, I have a conflict here, can’t do my job right, let someone else do it’. Everyone should act like this, in Poland too. For example, judge could say something along the lines ‘I don’t like this man, have a personal problem with him, can’t rule in his case’. So it’s a standard, in US it’s very strong but apparently not for McCabe.


But you’ve asked me to explain what’s it all about… OK, it’s a little bit complicated but here you go… First of all, American government doesn’t have authority to engage in any kind of electronic surveillance against US citizens. Under almost any circumstances it’s illegal and it’s very hard for various agencies to get a warrant, when the subject is US citizen - they are protected by constitution. So what trick Clinton [btw, Cejrowski doesn’t say ‘Clinton’ this time, he calls her by not-so-pleasant nickname] did? She wanted to spy on Trump and she managed to place a wire in Trumps HQ. How? She ordered so called dossier, where – you probably heard about this – is alleged that Trump has some shady dealings with Russians. So of course, FBI said: well we must spy on these Russians then! Not on Trump, US citizen – mind you – but on bad Russians who conspire against US and may influence election. It went like this: when Trump speaks, we [the FBI, he’s doing a little ‘act’ here – watch video if you like] are not listening; we erase everything Trump says from recordings, only Russians are in our interest.
It’s all about that, really. 


**HOST:** Ah yes, and now, after some time, when we know there was no collusion, no evidence supporting this Russia thing, I suppose we can tell they [FBI? Clintons?] actually did “cover their ears” while listening Trump [via wiretap], because if they knew what Trump was saying, why they lost election, right? [laughs]


**MR. CEJROWSKI:** But where is the ‘smoke’ in this story – first, this was Clinton-ordered document and of course Clinton was Trump rival in the POTUS race. Second, FBI did not verify it at all – it was full of totally made up allegations – as it turned out, dossier was written by some British agent with contacts in Russia, but he was imagining things out of thin air, for all we know. So, to sum up – based on falsified document, which FBI failed to verify, they placed a wiretap in Trump’s campaign HQ. So here you have answer to your question – all of this was illegal on, like, 3 different levels. 

[…]  
  
  
[Also, circa 51 min Mr. Cejrowski informs Polish audience how H. Clinton sold “American uranium” to Russia]



This is just short part of the interview (from 00:52:00 to 00:55:45) but I don’t have time to translate rest – I just wanted to shed some light on how one-sided coverage millions of people here are getting.  Translation may not be great, but I did my best to make it sufficiently precise. 


Now – I am not saying all coverage looks exactly like this and I don’t watch TVP often. But sometimes I do and I’ve never heard the word “Mueller”. Trump is generally praised, because his and our ruling party emigration politics (and many more, right-wing talking points) fit nicely together.


**I am wondering if and how main news channels in Europe cover the Mueller probe.**

**Could you please write how it is in your country?**


And, on a final note, I will be grateful if someone could point out – sentence-by-sentence – where Mr. Cejrowski shares non-factual statements in translated piece. I have a feeling there are quite few, however it’s getting hard to navigate through all of this lately…

The article has a few interesting points on the past and future of the US-European political relations. 

By Jemima Kelly

INTL-FCStone macro strategist Vincent Deluard put out a fun piece Wednesday night suggesting investment strategies for the end of the “post-transatlantic” world, in which he argues America should pivot away from Europe towards “the continent that matters -- Asia”.

He says the “transatlantic divorce” will dampen demand for the dollar and therefore weaken it, and will lead to “much, much higher” Treasury yields, as a leaderless and less predictable world will mean US sovereign debt will no longer be seen as risk-free:

&gt;In the charitable (European) view, Europe is to Uncle Sam what Athens was to imperial Rom [sic], a respected source of inspiration and culture. In the realistic (American) view, Europe is to the U.S. what Robin is to Batman, a mostly useless sidekick to the one true superhero.
&gt;The U.S. no longer sees the value of its alliance with this cluster of whining, declining mid-size powers. 

Ouch.

But he also argues that Europe too should reorient itself away from America, as it “no longer needs an alliance that has repeatedly hurt [its] economic interests”. See for instance Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council who had harsh words for the US this week.

China has overtaken the US as Germany's biggest non-European trade partner, and US trade with Europe now accounts for just 6 per cent of the total (down from 10 per cent in 1960). And Mr Deluard tells us that the shrinkage of Europe’s American dependency will speed up due to “historical changes in trade routes” (80 per cent of which -- by volume -- are maritime):

&gt;Control of the oil tanker route eventually allowed allied powers to recover from their early defeats in World War 2. The United States protected this route with a pearl necklace of military bases and navy fleets. This supremacy has not been challenged since the Royal Navy retreated from the Suez Canal in 1956. The U.S.-controlled Europe-Middle East-Asia sea route was the pillar of the 20th century world order and the ultimate justification of the Transatlantic alliance.
&gt;This triple geopolitical constraint on European prosperity is progressively relaxing and may cease to exist by the middle of this century. 

That's because the traditional route -- across the Taiwan straits, the South China Sea, the strait of Malacca, the Gulf of Aden, the Suez Canal, and then the strait of Gibraltar -- is no longer the fastest way to send cargo ships from Northeast Asia to Europe. The Northern Sea Route, which is getting bigger, shaves about 30 per cent off the distance and avoids pirates. See the map below, from the report -- the NSR is in red, while the Suez route is in turquoise.
Quill Cloud

The reason this route is opening up is because the ice caps are melting:

&gt;For now, trade volume on the Northern Sea Route is a statistical error: just 18 ships crossed the Northern Sea Route last year, down from a peak of 71 in 2013. However, time and global warming play in the NSR’s favor: a 984-foot liquefied natural gas tanker crossed the NSR without the aid of specialized ice-breaking vessels for the first time last year. The Copenhagen Business School estimates that the Arctic liner shipping will become economically feasible around 2040 if the ice cover continues to diminish at the present rate. 

A warm Arctic isn't his main argument. China's “One Belt, One Road” policy, which aims to connect 75 per cent of the world’s population in 40 countries within a decade, and to reduce the land-travelling time from London to Beijing to two days -- is another reason to encourage what Mr Deluard calls “le divorce”, as well as Europe's shrinking depency on Middle Eastern oil.

Still, global warming, eh. It's not all bad. ",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8mbjpf/investment_themes_for_a_posttransatlantic_world/,1

2023. Italian 	GDP doesn’t grow, but other indicators increase dramatically. 	Italy reaches 	50% renewable energy production. Canada, Norway, 	Finland, Denmark, Austria, 	Sweden adopt the NEM.  
 

2024. Holland, 	Netherlands, Luxenbourg, Portugal adopt the NEM. Scotland abandons 		United Kingdom and enters the UE, adopting the NEM in the process.  
 

2025. EU 	abandons GDP as main indicator. All members of EU adopt the NEM.  
 

2026. United 	Kingdom adopts the NEM, as well as Japan and Venezuela.  The Peoples 		Self-Determination Committee (PSC) is formed. It manages migration 	flows and 	immigrants are integrated in the society without any 	problem.

2040. A 	slowing in global warming is noticed. Also the rate of exctinction 	of species starts 	slowing down. Amazon forest is protected by 70%.  
 

2041. Global 	meat consumption has fallen by 80%.  
 

2042. Africa 	is subdivided in many more nations, borders have changed. Projects 	to 	repopulate species at risk are started. The African Rhinoceros 	is the symbol of these 	ones.

2044. Temperature 	starts to stabilize. China and North Korea remain the last nations 	that 	didn’t adopt the NEM. World reaches 80% of renewable energy 	production.  
 

2045. The 	risk rate of all the species that risk extinction is downgraded by 	one stage. 	Efforts to preserve specimen on the brink, at least in 	captivity, are made    
 

2046. China 	and North Korea (whose regimes have fallen after pressures) adopt 	the NEM.  
 

2047. Labs 	are enstablished on Mars. Here robots harvest cereals and produce 	goods that 	are sent to Earth.  
 

2048. World 	reaches 100% renewable. ACP starts showing its results as the the 	world 	cools down by 0.1°C.

2050. Global 	average temperature drops by 0,3°C. Global criminality rate has 	fallen by 	90% as well as suicide rate.  
 

What is the NEM? The NEM is an economical model where robots sustain the foundations of a nation, providing for everyone food, houses and other basic necessities for free. Energy as well is supplied freely thanks to renewable energy. This allows more people to specialize in more complex professions. I've been working on this for years now and i'll update what i wrote about it soon (already updated in italian, gotta update in english). Here's the link, you can find more details there.

1411,7oy19m,europe,[Discussion] What do you think about forcing longer warranty times?,5,,1515412267,,0,"Resources are limited and Recycling only goes so far. Planned Breakpoints make their was into products and there is nothing consumers can do. What is your opinion on making the mininum warranty longer than two years, depending on the product? Of course only if there is no user damage. Here are some of my thoughts:

Phones can last a very long time, but missing (security) updates and breaking components (see a certain LG series) can force users to upgrade quite often. Enforcing a 4 year warranty since the release of the phone seems like a reasonable time for updates and technical failure. Cheap phones that dont last seem like a bad idea in general for me.

Laptops are a bit more complicated as they can range from 200€ to 4000€, but software support isnt really a problem there. Warranties against technical failures could range from 4-6 (maybe 8?) Years depending on the model.

Other devices can be a bit more complicated, but there should be a solution too.

Do you think that the recycling is an alternative to decrease the environmental impact?

What type of lamps do you have at home? How much lamps there are in total?

Would you buy a roof lamp and/or a lamp for your home made with recycled wood and glass? 

Which lamp/s design do you like the most? 

How much would you be willing to pay for one of this lamps? 

Where would you like to acquire them?

thoughts on the Winners/Losers of a US hegemony

The US hegemony has been the most prosperous, peaceful period of history for developed, allied countries. The US has managed the defense of europe, Australia, North America, disallowed large scale South American conflicts, Japan, Philippines, and many more. The US has actively pushed for democratic governments for decades ( not a utopian system but better than most). The US rebuilt Europe after the war instead of adding taxes , and repayment debt from them ( a novelty that was not the norm at the time). With really only a couple of rules, you will not fight one another and you have to be our ally against the USSR. But there are finite resources and this world is closer to a zero sum game than people think. 

The ultimate winners in this heavily free trade system is not the US. The ultimate winners were Germany, Japan, China, and other heavy trading countries. The US won in the sense that USSR lost ( this deal was always a defensive deal not a financial one), but the US lost a disproportionate amount compared to allies in defense budget, in sharing our tech, and not shackling Europe to the traditional roles of losers of war.  Also, the US is much less attached to a free trade system and we would be just fine if not better without it( vast majority of our trade is through Canada and Mexico but we manage all free trade through our powerful navy).

The losers of this system are less obvious but essentially it was anyone who didn’t play the game so mostly Russia, Cuba, the non oil states of the Middle East, and any country without money or strategic value (so Africa which will not thrive under any system that isn’t solely built to police/put in money to Africa). 

People will always hate the boss. If Germany was in charge people would hate them, same with China, same with the U.K., same with France. But the US has brought the world through the introduction of planet destroying weapons, rapidly world changing technology, and the first peaceful global economy. People are excited to see this system fail but I’m not sure they’ll like what comes next. When big brother isn’t there to pull the kids apart the kids will fight it out  and when the kids fight lots of death happens ( to steal that stupid quote from trump).  This Turkey/Kurd conflict is only the start in a world where the US doesn’t care about what’s happening past our doorstep. It probably won’t be europe for a few more years but when the US apathy is at full swing, Europe thinks Russia is the biggest threat. They don’t realize their military prowess is so low Turkey( or Iran, or SA, or Israel or NKorea)  could lay waste to most of them 1 on 1.

Because I'm sure that you haven't heard that yet \- I want to let you know what's happening in Poland right now   


*Processing img jzlwod4qpi211...*

**Short explanation:**

Companies in Poland are buying garbage (including toxic and/or this difficult to store) from all over the Europe and store it in Poland. They are doing that for the cheapest price and don't care at all about storing it in the right way. As you can see from the map below, those places are often cities based near highways and this issue is more common in the western part of Poland, because it is much easier to drop those garbage there while driving back from other EU countries. This is more common now because of China's ban for garbage import.  


Why are there so many fires? Often those landfills are often not designed to store such garbage. There are also speculations that mafia could be involved. Looks kinda like a domino effect, owners of those landfills can be in panic and burn the whole places down **(Speculation)**

  
List of articles which are explaining everything \- I'm sorry that every one of it is written in Polish, but I've found just one article in English about this problem. I've checked with google translator and it looks ok, you can ask me in the comments if something isn't clear.

1534,b9pnui,europe,NATO is facing new challenges for the 70th anniversary,0,,1554461401,,0,"April 4, NATO celebrated its 70th anniversary. Established in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was intended to confront the USSR and armed defense against a possible attack by the ""Reds"".

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years, NATO has survived the victory over the USSR in the Cold War, confrontation with the countries of the Warsaw Pact. It was on the verge of disbandment. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the meaning of the existence of the organization disappeared. Russia of the 90s did not pose any threat, begged for loans, and with great gratitude received humanitarian aid.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the 2000s, the forgotten threat of all began to remind of itself again. At the Russian landfills began to ride new tanks, modern aircraft appeared in the sky. The bloc’s defense was asked by the former socialist countries and the Baltic states.

&amp;#x200B;

And on the eve of the 70th anniversary, the block faces new challenges. The trouble came from no waiting. The internal contradictions of the Allies, related to the amount of funding, led to the fact that US President Donald Trump raised the question of the possible withdrawal of the United States from NATO. Such a step would jeopardize the existence of the bloc, because America is contributing the largest sums to the budget of the bloc (in 2018, total defense spending amounted to $ 936 billion, of which 67% were contributed by the United States).

&amp;#x200B;

The second equally important point is the tense situation on the eastern border of the block, caused by the armed opposition of Ukraine with Russia. Brussels adopted economic measures, expressed in sanctions against Moscow. In addition, US Permanent Representative to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said that the North Atlantic Alliance is going to ensure the safe passage of Ukrainian ships through the Kerch Strait. To this end, the Organization will send warships to the Black Sea.

&amp;#x200B;

By repeating a situation similar to the November clash, NATO has the risk of being drawn into a full-scale armed conflict, defending a country that is not part of it. And this is not necessary for Brussels. Yes, and the Russian authorities are unlikely to want such a development.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I would like to wish the bloc a successful existence, wise leadership. And of course the peace. After all, for this it was created.",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/b9pnui/nato_is_facing_new_challenges_for_the_70th/,2

1622,comeps,europe,Learned today that Germany is freezing part of it's contribution to the Amazon preservation fund because the Brazilian president is unwilling to fight deforestation and actually endorses it. What would be your thoughts on an European boycott against Brazilian products?,132,,1565465123,,0,"Much of what we import from Brazil comes from farms and mines on regions that were previously forest areas. Farmers and miners have been cutting down the forest and kicking out and killing the native Indians that oppose them and killing off local fauna. The Amazon fund was established to help prevent that. Now the Brazilian president, Bolsonaro, is endorsing groups that deforest, and states that the deforestation the EU talks about, is exaggerated and ""fake news"". If freezing part of the money that is supposed to encourage the preservation of the Amazon doesn't work, wouldn't boycotting the producers that benefit from deforestation be the solution instead? Many countries and groups of people vehemently boycott some Israeli products, and while the Israel/Palestine question may be a matter of what your politics are, the Amazon isn't, just about everyone agrees, it's important to the whole world that we preserve it. Incredibly rich corporations and agribusiness players are getting rich destroying one of the most important ecosystems in the world because we pay them to. Shouldn't we boycott them? Maybe Stop investing in Brazilian companies and importing from them altogether until a real change takes place?

1658,e9kubz,europeanunion,European Council 12th and 13th of December,0,,1576138367,,0,"## What is the European Council?

The European Council is an institution of the European Union that regularly meets once every 3 months.

The European Council consists of:  
- one head of state / government from each of the **28 member states**  
- the President of the European Commission, **Ursula von der Leyen**  
- the President of the European Council, **Charles Michel**

The High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (**Josep Borrell**) and the President of the European Parliament (**David Sassoli**) are usually also in attendance.

The European Council sets out the EU's general direction and political priorities. Sometimes, it negotiates and agrees on issues too contentious for approval by other EU institutions. The European Council generally does not make final legislative decisions, but it does sometimes discuss important legislative issues.

**Note:**  
- This will be the first European Council for Urula von der Leyen as President of the European Commission and Charles Michel as President of the European Council.  
- The United Kingdom will have a Parliamentary election on the 12th. Brexit is a major subject.  
- [the British government has indicated it will not attend](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-government-to-skip-eu-summit/)  
- [there is a Reddit Live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/1441bhfdj2zx7/) :)

## Subjects on the Agenda

The following issues are expected to be on the agenda for the European Council to discuss...

### Climate Change

&gt; The European Council will finalise its guidance on the EUʼs long-term strategy on climate change to be submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat in early 2020. EU leaders will focus on the target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

[EU climate change policies](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/climate-change/)

Note: On Wednesday 11th of December Frans Timmermans presented the European Green Deal to the European Parliament.

[European Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en)

### Long Term Budget
ddi
&gt; EU heads of state or government will discuss the multiannual financial framework (MFF) — the EU's long-term budget. The discussion will be based on a negotiation box with figures prepared by Finland's presidency, as requested by the leaders in October.

The Multiannual Financial Framework will cover the EU's budget for 2021 to 2027.

[MFF Timeline](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-budgetary-system/multiannual-financial-framework/mff-negotiations/)

### External Relations

&gt; The European Council may also address specific external relations issues in the light of developments on the international scene.

Possible discussion points are:  
- Turkey's invasion of Syria  
- [JCPOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) (Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action) known commonly as the Iran nuclear deal.

### Euro Summit

&gt; On 13 December there will be a meeting of the Euro Summit (inclusive format). EU27 leaders will take stock of progress made on the implementation of the June 2019 Statement of the Euro Summit, including the:
&gt; - revision of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty  
&gt; - budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness (BICC)  
&gt; - technical work on the strengthening of the banking union

[Euro Summit agenda and background](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/euro-summit/2019/12/13/)

### Brexit

&gt; On 13 December, EU27 leaders will discuss Brexit and preparations for the negotiations on future EU-UK relations after the withdrawal.

The United Kingdom will have an election on the 12th of December, during the European Council. The EU leaders are expected to take stock of the election result on the 13th.

The **[Power from Statistics](https://powerfromstatistics.eu/home)** conference is part of a joint initiative by Eurostat and European Political Strategy Centre. It...

&gt;[...] aims to bring together eminent representatives of different perspectives of society, to consult them on what future information needs will be for informing policy, and how these information needs could be met by the European official statistics community.

&gt;[...]

&gt;[...] The outcome of the discussions at the high-level conference will feed into a ""Guidance report"". The report will contain a number of recommendations, setteing out a path for how to future-proof official statistics, with a 2030 time perspective.

&gt;They aim to guide the provision of ""official statistics to tomorrow"" that will be capable of delivering evidence to the policymakers of the future.

https://preview.redd.it/7i9qg8ge8yr61.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3ae632ea638958b470db741154b80013325c213

The Gazprom-owned operator of the controversial Nord Stream 2  pipeline across the Baltic Sea to Germany has mobilized a second  pipelaying vessel Akademik Chersky to continue laying pipes for Nord  Stream 2 as the Russian gas project remains at gunpoint of the US and  Europe.

The project is considered highly controversial as it increases  Europe’s dependence on Russian gas, while providing a strategic source  of revenue for Russia and the Kremlin.

At the same time pipelaying works will soon be launched in the Baltic sea for another project – the Baltic pipe.

All the tubes have already been manufactured and are to be laid in  summer. The preparatory works have already been started on construction  site. It is important to note that despite the ongoing Covid-19  pandemic, the construction of the Baltic Pipe is on track, as reported  polish Wprost  (https://www.wprost.pl/bezpieczenstwo-energetyczne/10434786/ruszyla-budowa-gazociagu-baltic-pipe.html).

“The construction of the Baltic Pipe is on schedule. All the  necessary contracts have been signed with contractors and suppliers, all  items have been delivered. The pipes for the Baltic Pipe offshore  section have already been fully manufactured, most of them are ready,  and more than half of them have been delivered to the site,” – said the  representative of the Polish government on strategic energy  infrastructure, Piotr Naimski.

When completed in October 2022, the Baltic Pipe will transport  natural gas from the North Sea to Poland via Denmark. The pipe will be  900km long, its capacity will reach 10 billion cubic meters of gas per  annum. The construction is estimated at €1.6 billion – the funds are  allocated by a consortium of commercial banks and via two EU’s  initiatives: the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and the Trans-European  Networks for Energy Program (TEN-E). The Baltic Pipeline will consist  of five key segments: North Sea Offshore, Onshore Denmark, Compressor  Station Denmark, Baltic Sea Offshore and Onshore Poland  (https://www.baltic-pipe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BalticPipe-Project-Implementation-Stage.pdf).

The Baltic Pipe is a strategic EU infrastructure project. Its  implementation is consistent with the energy policy objectives of the  European Union: strengthening competition, integrating gas markets,  enhancing security of supply, and effective implementation of  sustainable development principles. The EU has included Baltic Pipe on  its list of key infrastructure projects that are of common interest to  Europe – also known as “PCI projects”. This is due to the essential role  Baltic Pipe could play in contributing to the development of Europe’s  internal gas market, and the strengthening the EU’s security of supply.

The project, involving bi-directional pipeline segments, will not  only facilitate natural gas supply from Norway to Poland and other  countries of the Baltic region, but also enable reverse transmission  from Poland to Denmark and Sweden.

Also, the Baltic Pipe is strategically important for Poland which  strives to diversify its natural gas suppliers. In one of his interview  Andrzej Duda claimed: “We have no doubt that it is not only  Polish-Norwegian-Danish project. It is important project for the energy  industry of Europe, for the energy independence of the European Union.  The project relates to the future of the Eastern Europe and our part of  the world.”

Poland, being one of the oldest purchasers of Russian gas, is  oriented towards the launch of the project to be scheduled on 2022,  thought, on purpose. Because on the 31st of December, 2022, a  long-lasting deal – the Yamal Contract, signed between Poland and  Russia in 1996 – on the import of Russian gas terminates. As the  Contract says, the Yamal gas pipeline, running through Belarus, annually  supplies Poland with up to 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas. The  Baltic Pipe project has a completion date of the 1st of October, 2022, established in order to reach production capacity and terminate the gas trade with Russia before the 1st of January, 2023. Consequently, when the project is fulfilled in 2022, the Russian gas monopoly is brought to an end.

**The Baltic Pipe vs Nord Stream 2**

TheBaltic Pipe project is being developed by the Danish gas and  electricity transmission system operator Energinet and the Polish gas  transmission system operator Gaz-System, both participate in the project  in equal shares. Since neither Denmark nor Poland are authorized to  make sole decision regarding the infrastructural project, the  transparency is ensured. The situation regarding controversial Nord  Stream 2 is a kind of different one. A 51% share of Nord Stream 2  belongs to Russian operator Nord Stream 2 AG. Consequently, all  decisions on the pipeline are to be adopted after Russia’s approval only  and shall comply with its geopolitical agenda.

The funds for the construction of the Baltic Pipe are being allocated  by the EU: by the Trans-European Networks for Energy program and  Connecting Europe Facility foundation, engaged in the development of  infrastructural projects which are a subject of common interest of the  whole Europe. The expenditure on the construction of the Nord Stream 2  is mainly covered by Russia’s money. Hence, Gazprom as the main  shareholder of the pipeline, invests a sum which covers more than a half  of the costs of the project — the remaining part, estimated at 5  billion dollars, is invested by Engie, Royal Dutch Shell, OMV, Uniper  and Wintershall.

The Baltic Pipe has become a landmark for Poland in its strive to  diminish heavy dependence on Russian gas, inherited from the communist  era. Warsaw hopes that, from the beginning of 2023, when the contract  between Poland and Gazprom is to be terminated, the Baltic Pipe will  replace Russian supplies through Yamal-Europe pipeline and serve as a  kind of „stabilizing factor“ when Russian gas monopoly will be rejected.

If you want to have a better understanding about natural weather event such as floods, earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption or global warming, climate, etc. you must know the basic Earth map.  
 

The Earth map I am talking about is not the geopolitical map between nations, but the whole system relate to the Earth environment you are living in.  
 

**There are 3 layers on the Earth:**  
 1. The Sky.  
 2. The Earth Land.  
 3. The Sea/Ocean.  
 

The air, energy and organic chemical constantly go around from up to down to up by a perfect balance setup by the Earth Creator.  
 

All the natural catastrophe only come when that balance is break, when at least 1 layer have problem. And the problem is “blocking” the flow of the air/energy in that system.  
 

From the ancient time till now, the problem is mostly usually the Earth Land.  
 All because of stupid, cannot control actions, activities from all kind of different beings.  
 I am not going to discuss the past history many thousands to millions years ago, but today I am talking about humanity only.  
 

**There are 3 major mistakes humans made which directly affect the environment:**  
 1. Hunting wild animals.  
 2. Mining and using metals on the surface.  
 3. Create artificial chemicals/stuffs.  
 

The problem is that they are using but cannot control it.  
 Do you know what the Earth System trying to do by flooding, storm, earth quake, volcano eruption?  
 The answer is melting and dissolve back those “stupid stuffs” that blocking the air/energy flow of life on Earth.  
 

**In Hindu, there is a teaching that “people should burn their personal stuffs when do not use anymore”.**  
 

How many years would take to dissolve back those stuffs if you only bury it to the land?  
 It is depend, from few days with organic foods to many thousand years with those plastic clothes, bag, chair, etc.  
 

But the Earth System do not care, it only do whatever it take to balance the system.  
 That is why you have Global Warming, Climate Change !  
 The reason is not about producing too much CO2 to air.  
 The root reason is not to burn the “blocking” hard-to-dissolved unused stuffs back to the system.  
 But many nations are burying those unused stuffs instead of direct burning.  
 

Wearing organic clothes vs plastic clothes vs go naked.  
 Stay in nature with bamboo house vs stay in concrete house in the city.  
 When you feel hottest, when you feel coldest, go ask yourselves !  
 

This is not just personal theory craft, but I am using the sacred religion teaching made by Gods and real life result to explain it to you guys.  
 

The current virus pandemic is the last warning from nature.  
 When you are trying to lift a heavy stuffs, if you do not stop, your hand will going to bleed.  
 

The bleed here is very similar to a volcano eruption !  
 

Humanity in 2020 can deal with floods, rain, storm but cannot able to deal with volcano eruption, you must remember that.  
 

This is the best lesson about climate change global warming subject I can give you guys.  
 If you guys still cannot understand and waking up, then the natural disaster will come in the very near future.

After several months of this stupid nonsense virus pandemic.  
 I can now confirm that the “cure” will be revealed to the public must related to climate change, global warming subject. And it must contribute and have direct impact on human life with the goal is to save this civilization from natural catastrophe disaster.  
 

**The public cure for the new corona virus NCOV SARS-COV-2 must meet 4 requirements:**  
 1. Have a real positive effect on human body.  
 2. Solve the climate change problem.  
 3. Just enough solution, not overkill.  
 4. Got approved by super deities/gods who are residing in many temples/jungle/mountain.  
 

As a real legendary savior, I can reveal to you that special cure right now.  
 **The SARS-1 was cured by “get closer with nature”, so the cure method for the SARS-COV-2 must be the same but will higher pressure with the same object “get much closer with natural environment”.**  
 

**Here are the result all of you are waiting for:**  
 \- Changing bedroom and bed condition so the body can have direct connection with Earth nature.  
 \- Changing wearing clothes from plastic polyester to 100% organic material such as cotton/hemp.  
 

The direct connection with Earth nature is like you walking barefoot on the clay or sleep on the sand.  
 The bedroom wall will be made by natural material such as bamboo, hempcrete, clay, etc.  
 The bed you are sleeping in will be made with tree part.  
 

Many of you may wonder what is the benefit of above method.  
 The answer is that:all human body have ion- and ion+, when you have direct touch/connection with nature, the “unwanted ion type” will secret return back to natural environment. So that your body will be more balance and feel stronger, have more energy.  
 

You can do your own research on this subject on search engine, there are some videos already talk about it.  
 

The goal is not just raise awareness of the public, but also save planet Earth from natural catastrophe.  
 

The house material will be built with another material but with cheaper price, instead of now almost all toxic hard concrete, so as the wearing clothes and other stuffs.  
 

Above method is the only want got approved by super deities, natural gods. All kind of other “solution” like vaccines, drugs made in lab house will never be allowed to be used. All the super deities will do everything include casting floods, break building, earthquake, tsunami, etc. in order to prevent it.

You are not living alone on Earth, there are also many super deities, super beings with many thousand years of age who are residing on Earth as well.  
 

There is no any science can explain and tell you exactly what, when, why those natural disaster catastrophe come.  
 The only way for human to learn, understand and control it is by using common sense and history sacred teaching.  
 

**The current virus pandemic is a proxy war about:**  
 1. Climate Change, Global Warming Subject.  
 2. International Financial Money System.  
 

Because it cannot be real for the casualties death number are way too low compare to the other deadly virus pandemic event in history.  
 

The natural disasters only come when “human are too stupid”.  
 When they are too stupid?  
 When they do not understand the Earth game correctly.  
 

**I have said the Earth game have 2 parts:**  
 \- Part 1 is team work in order to find the Himalaya mountain rage.  
 \- Part 2 is personal job in order to find &amp; conquer mount Kailash.  
 

The downfall of most empires, nations throughout history is because they do not understand that game rule.  
 

\- Part 1 here I really mean is that have a fair community people support each other when “necessary”, but you cannot control enslave and treat them like animals.  
 \- Part 2 here I mean everybody should have some room of freedom, free choice when they need, so they can self discover the Earth game.  
 

But many so called governments was and are treating their citizens terrible, they do not allowed people to talk “bad” against government, do not allow to report corruption,etc.  
 

Have any of you wonder they China got virus pandemic and a historic rain floods just few months in 2020.  
 Do know you in China, there was some prophecies made by some “beings” correct 100% about what will happen in the future for the last 1000-2000 years?  
 Because they are not mortal humans but they are super beings have lived on Earth for many thousand years and still observing the Earth game between mortal humans.  
 

I would more convinced that those super deities/natural gods has made corona virus NCOV and many other diseases and other natural catastrophe in history to wake up and destroy the regime/empire/nation because those leaders have failed too lead the people.  
 

This is the last part in 2 part series about the connection between natural catastrophe and humanity.  
 **Overall, the natural disaster only come when “human are too stupid”, or in more details:**  
 1. They are destroying the nature environment.  
 2. The game/society rule between humans affair are not fair and too imbalance.  
 

If they do not break any of those 2 conditions, the natural catastrophe cannot come.  
 Any other reasons are all wrong, stop “gambling”, you must face the truth !

Many of you want to see world peace and less chaos, but the only way to make your dream come true is you must listen to me the world savior, if not then that would never happen unless you are immortal beings who have little interested in mortal human life.  
 

**There are many type of war conflicts going on Earth in 2020, but mostly only 4 types:**  
 **Tier 1:** Religious War.  
 **Tier 2:** Countries Nations War.  
 **Tier 3:** Ideology groups about how to run the social life system such as Capitalism vs Socialism, Climate Change Global Warming, Vegan vs Non-Vegan, Black people vs White people, this that, etc.  
 **Tier 4:** Between people about what is correct or wrong, good or bad, etc. about certain events like a sport match, a scandal, a movie, etc.  
 

For me the World Savior, all of them are very easily to resolved.  
 And the corona virus NCOV COVID is a golden opportunity to end the religious war, and tell people the true purpose of religions was for studying, education.  
 All what you need to do is 1 national government contact me to receive the perfect formula cure which is a set of many religions teaching will make body better off.  
 

\- **Do the Kosher Food in Judaism good for general people, and better than the rest?**  
 Yes, it does.  
 \- **Do eating like Ramadan event in Islam good for human body?**  
 Yes,it does.  
 \- **Do cutting all hair like a monk in Buddhism increase your intelligent and overall health?**  
 Yes, it does.  
 

Just a few examples. The version will be announced to the public if have opportunity will be much better.  
 

If you can resolve the most difficult one the religious war, thus unify all religions, then all kind of national war, groups war are easily to be resolved !!!  
 

Many of you may have different ideologies about many other subjects, but if you want to do anything, you must first unify the people through religions. And the best way now is get behind me The Legendary Savior, you have nothing to lose, all I need is just one announcement from 1 national government !  
 

Remember the deadline is **15-09-2020 September 15th** **2020**, I only listen and answer question at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**.  
 After that timeline, even the angel/gods/deities come, I will still not going to help any nation unless a super volcano erupt, or any other kind of natural mega disaster occur.

If you ask between a petrol/gas car vs a electric car, which one will bring natural catastrophe faster, sooner to this civilization, then my answer is electric car !  
 

The science and theory say that: CO2 cause global warming, cause ice melting and to root problem of the “future nature mega disaster”.  
 It sound very logical because when you burn fire near ice, it will melt, if you burn woods in your house,you will get warmer, so CO2 is the problem.  
 

Hey what if metals, technology (including everything made in lab house) is the direct cause of Climate Change.  
 

Why don’t you ask why and how metals go rust?  
 It is because of air, fire, water.  
 

So the more metals, technology stuffs on the surface, the more natural catastrophe disaster come to you.  
 

The theory CO2 only maybe “correct” about ice melting, but what about storm,earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption which was happened many timesin the past?  
 

Use your common sense and pick the correct theory.  
 **CO2** vs **Metals, Technology**.  
 One theory only “maybe correct” about 1 catastrophe event.  
 But other theory satisfy all the natural catastrophe events.  
 

If you ask why the metals on the surface go rust then it is the “unripe product”.  
 A small little air can do it, so with high amount of quantity require a lot of air (storm, tsunami, floods).  
 

Why it melting? Then the answer it is because it is not the “original products/materials of life on Earth”, simply like that.  
 

Most of word leaders are digging the grave for this entire civilization by gambling on the wrong CO2 theory.  
 

Technology, science cannot predict the right temperature, when rain come, what wind direction, and cannot know the secret of life exist  beyond human eyes and any kind of technology.  
 

Go ask yourself, your friends and compare both theories above and make your own conclusion about climate change global warming subject.

1811,iqhaa6,europeanunion,The NCOVID Lock Down Prove CO2 Emission Do Not Cause Global Warming Climate Change,0,1.0,1599788944,,0,"**The NCOVID Lock Down Prove CO2 Emission Do Not Cause Global Warming Climate Change**  
 

What are guys are witnessing is just the final result of the battle about CO2 Emission theory cause global warming, climate change or not ?!  
 

The result is very clear, the answer is no.  
 

What happen when corona virus lock down?  
 People stay at home, much less work, thus less CO2 emission produced everyday.  
 So the CO2 Emission in 2020 is smaller/lower than CO2 million produced in 2019, for sure.  
 

But guess what?  
 The natural catastrophe disaster is stronger than ever, much more worse than in 2019, and 2020 is not yet fully up.  
 

\-Record fire in the Amazon Forest.  
 \- Doomdays wild fire screen in California, USA.  
 \- Record rain, floods in China where you got 60+ straight raining days.  
 \- Record typhoons, storm in Korea where you got 3 big typhoon in a span of 20 days, while that nation got very little typhoon before.  
 

That is the result you get for real life less CO2 Emission produced.  
 

Climate Change is a too complex subject for mortal human can fully understand, let alone “gambling” in it.  
 It such as waste of time to debate CO2 emission subject for the real life result speak for itself.  
 

**The question now is which natural disaster you want to see and face in real life:**  
 1. A sea level slow rising but can be predicted and see.  
 2. A sudden death disaster event such as super typhoon, earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption.  
 

Some part of the world sea level is up, but some part of the world there will be more living zone.  
 All you need is migrate to that new area.  
 

But if you got sudden death natural disaster events like super typhoon,earthquake, volcano eruption, then you got very little to no choice.  
 

The problem now for this civilization is that,most world leaders with big ego will most likely do not admit their mistakes but will fight till dead.  
 They are fighting to keep their ""elite/leaders"" useless title.  
 

It is similar to the fact that I am the real world savior, but guys denying it.  
 When I ask who else can be the savior or what the savior in your opinion,you guys cannot give an answer but only said “the savior will coming and it is not you”. OK fine, you guys can continue live like that till your default dead.  
 Instead of admitting mistake and change, you guys only blaming others and do not open your mindset.  
 

It is tough because after becoming “adult” people have little less memory space in their brain till their old age, that’s why it is hard to change.  
 

The stupid non-sense corona virus NCOV event must end right now, if not you guys only get more hash natural disaster event never seen before, and much worse than sea level rising.  
 

Stop blaming and craft other theories like the gods did that, the people in the lock down angry cause that, etc.  
 

My deadline is still till only **15-09-2020 September 15th** **2020**.  
 I am not threatening with nuclear weapon.  
 I only telling you my future choice and action.  
 Whether I able use thought to command natural Gods is another funny question.  
 

Remember that all the ancient prophecies telling you that only the savior can save you and give you the right direction in life.  
 

It is about faith, but if you do not have faith in me, you guys cannot change your default death life from the beginning. Because the purpose of the life game is that you must change you, not seeking direct help from others.  
 

I am only here to give you little extra knowledge extra option to help you find the right direction to escape the matrix of life. The final choice is still yours.

You got to love how a parliamentary institution that exercises the legislative function of Europe is dependent on MEPs who are more responsive to the interests of their constituents than they are to the interests of Europe, or in the context of this recent declaration, the whole world. 

Until today, these MEPs may've not been familiar with how important it is to meet climate targets, and as such, not being able to make an informed decision. Or, they may be influenced by special interests when making their decisions. This can lead to decisions that are not in the best interest of the public or the whole world.  These MEPs are also subject to political pressure from their home countries when making decisions on EU policies. This can result in decisions that are not in line with the EU's climate targets.

Atleast now, we'll see a legal framework (through The Renewable Energy Directive) that is paving the way for the bloc to use more nuclear energy and gas as energy sources across the different sectors of the economy of each member state.",[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/europes/comments/vsvu6o/eu_parliament_declares_nuclear_power_and_gas_as/,1
1846,vytuq1,europes,Energy carriers for Germany and the EU,0,1.0,1657798984,world,0,"  The leading economy of the European Union - Germany - is beginning to implement the policy of abandoning Russian energy carriers, setting an example for all other European countries. Until recently, Russia supplied Germany with 40 % of coal and oil consumed, as well as as much as 50 % of natural gas (another 24 % came from Norway, 20 % from the Netherlands and 6 % was produced in Germany itself).

Official Berlin confirmed that from August 1, Germany will abandon Russian coal, and from

December 31, 2022, Russian oil as well (which was provided for by the fifth and sixth packages of EU general sanctions against the Russian Federation). A more difficult task for the German government is to find ways to replace the supply of “blue fuel” from the Russian Federation. Germany is now rapidly working to complete the launch of four LNG terminals and connect them to the national gas distribution network: Brunsbüttel (Schleswig-Holstein); Wilhelmshaven (Lower Saxony); Stade (Lower Saxony, near Hamburg); Rostock (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania).

It should also be noted that the Polish Prime Minister M. Morawiecki offered the German government to use the Polish gas facilities. First, we are talking about LNG receiving terminals in the Baltic ports of Swinoujscie and Gdansk. Secondly, the technical launch of the Baltic Pipe gas pipeline, which Copenhagen and Warsaw laid along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, and which will deliver gas from fields on the Norwegian shelf to Denmark and Poland, should take place on October 1, 2022. At the same time, all surpluses of Norwegian gas can be exported to Germany. Of course, Poland will not have too much gas excesses, but this gas can be used as a contingency measure for Germany. Germany can also use other nearby LNG terminals in Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Klaipeda (Lithuania).

In general, “blue fuel” for Germany’s internal needs for the coming autumn-winter period should be enough, but, of course, it will rise in price, which will be reflected in the price of gas for German housing and communal services. This is the price paid by Germany for the Russian “gas needle,” that the German government deliberately put the whole country on. Now it is necessary to get rid of this “needle” thanks to LNG supplies from Arab countries and the USA.

In addition, the German government will have to slightly increase the time frame for the implementation of the “energy turnaround” (Energiewende). This concept involves the gradual refusal of Germany from the use of fossil hydrocarbon fuels and nuclear energy with the transition to renewable energy sources (RES). Previously, Germany planned to increase the share of electricity generated from RES to 50 % by 2030, to 65 % by 2040 and to 80 % by 2050. This goal planned to be achieved through the rapid closure of all coal-fired power plants, the slow closure of nuclear power plants, development of new technologies related to the use of synthetic gases and hydrogen, as well as increasing investment in “green” energy sources. It is now clear that it is still too early for German and other European coal-fired power stations and nuclear power plants to close.

In general, as part of the response to the “gas war” unleashed by Russia, the European Union still has to do two important things. First, create a single operator that will set the procurement parameters and closely monitor the uniform and timely filling of underground gas storage facilities in EU member states. And secondly, to create a single payment operator that would take all necessary actions in order to avoid blackmail from the suppliers of “blue fuel” regarding payment in one or another payment system and in one or another currency.",[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/europes/comments/vytuq1/energy_carriers_for_germany_and_the_eu/,1
1847,x1ef11,europes,Gas: Spain Instead of Germany?,0,1.0,1661851385,EU,0,"Madrid sees Spain as Europe's gas hub in the next few years! Today, 45 % of Europe's LNG storage facilities are concentrated in Spain, as well as more than 30 % of regasification capacities (conversion of LNG from a liquid state to a gaseous). For the past six months, Madrid has not had time to conclude contracts with other European capitals on usage of the Spanish gas infrastructure.

If Germany and Russia launched the Nord Stream 2 in 2021 (as originally planned), then the Germans would be able to receive into their system (through all pipelines) a volume of gas in the amount of 395 billion cubic meters per year, despite the fact that about 400 billion cubic meters consumes the entire EU in a year, while Germany itself needs much less for domestic consumption — about 90 billion cubic meters. Therefore, Germany, receiving a huge amount of “blue fuel” from the Russian Federation, would not only meet its own needs, but would also turn for the whole of Europe into a major hub of Russian natural gas received through pipelines.

However, after February 24, 2022, the West anti-war coalition gave a decisive rebuff to Putin's Russia, as a result of which the Nord Stream 2 was frozen (probably for a very long time), and the EU began to urgently implement a policy of diversifying energy supplies. Thanks to the latter, Spain has the opportunity to become a major LNG hub, which it can re-export to other European countries (having de facto taken away this hypothetical function from Germany).

In general, the recently established relations and signed contracts between LNG suppliers from all over the world and its consumers in Europe allow us to assert that in the next year and a half of the transition period, not a single European state will experience a shortage of “blue fuel”. If, however, the EU countries will comply with the European Commission’s recommendations, then it will be much easier for them to go through a difficult period of diversifying energy sources. It means efforts to reduce gas consumption by at least 15%, the establishment in the EU of a single operator for purchases and payments for gas, the mandatory filling of underground gas storage facilities by 90 % by the beginning of the heating season, etc.

In the long term, the dependence of the whole of Europe on Russian natural gas supplied through pipelines will be reduced to zero. We are talking about the implementation (primarily) by the German government and (more slowly) by the entire European Union of the “energy turnaround” strategy (Energiewende), which involves the gradual transition to the use of hydrogen energy and renewable energy sources (the energy from the sun, wind, rivers, etc.) instead of fossil hydrocarbon fuels and nuclear energy. After all, yesterday this strategy provided for the rapid closure of all coal-fired power stations, the gradual closure of nuclear power plants and the intensive development of new technologies related to the use of syngases and hydrogen.

After Russia unleashed a revanchist war against Ukraine in order to build a neo-empire, the deadlines for achieving the goals of the energy transition to “green” energy were readjusted, the transition period was prolonged, and its implementation was difficult. Today, the EU countries are reactivating stopped coal-fired thermal power plants, extending the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants, massively building LNG terminals and regasification facilities, as well as interconnectors that allow countries to exchange both “blue fuel” and electricity. In general, Europe, while maintaining a unified position both in the matter of confrontation with the totalitarian Russian Federation, and on the path of an energy turnaround, of course, will be able to achieve its goals effectively.",[],,https://www.reddit.com/r/europes/comments/x1ef11/gas_spain_instead_of_germany/,1
